    "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a method for finding latent similarities between documents treated as a bag of words by using a low rank approximation. It is used for document classification, clustering and retrieval. For example, LSA can be used to search for prior art given a new patent application. In this homework, we will implement a small library for simple latent semantic analysis as a practical example of the application of SVD. The ideas are very similar to PCA. SVD is also used in recommender systems in an similar fashion (for an SVD-based recommender system library, see [Surpise](http://surpriselib.com)). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement a toy example of LSA to get familiar with the ideas. If you want to use LSA or similar methods for statistical language analysis, the most efficient Python libraries are probably [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io) - these also provide an online algorithm - i.e. the training information can be continuously updated. Other useful functions for processing natural language can be found in the [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/)."

If we set all but the top $k$ singular values to 0, the reconstructed matrix is essentially $U_k \\Sigma_k V_k^T$, where $U_k$ is $m \\times k$, $\\Sigma_k$ is $k \\times k$ and $V_k^T$ is $k \\times n$.

Since $A = U \\Sigma V^T$, we also have $V = A^T U S^{-1}$ using orthogonality and the rule for transposing matrix products. This suggests that in order to map the new document to the same concept space, first find the tf-idf vector $v$ for the new document - this must contain all (and only) the terms present in the existing tf-idx matrix. Then the query vector $q$ is given by $v^T U_k \\Sigma_k^{-1}$. Find the 10 documents most similar to the new document and the 10 most dissimilar. "

Community-level programs have the potential to affect self-efficacy and may be helpful in overcoming common barriers to self-management. The Neighborhood Health Talker Program used community members trained as cultural health brokers to engage their communities in conversations about \"living diabetes well.\" Program evaluators used mixed methods to analyze post-conversation surveys and Health Talker field notes. These indicated an increase in diabetes-related knowledge and increased confidence among conversation participants. Conversations included discussion of barriers and facilitators to lifestyle changes and effective self-management that are frequently overlooked in a clinical setting.',\n",

However, the molecular mechanisms of EGCG-induced apoptosis in B lymphoma cells are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of EGCG on proliferation and apoptosis in the B lymphoma cell lines Jeko-1 and Raji, and determine the underlying mechanisms. Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were determined by the cell counting kit (CCK-8) assay; apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using the Annexin V-PE/7AAD double staining; Fas, Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA expression levels were determined by real-time PCR; caspase activity was measured by the caspase activity assay kit; the expression levels of apoptosis-associated proteins were determined by western blot analysis. We demonstrated that EGCG induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In agreement, EGCG upregulated the mRNA expression of Fas and Bax while downregulating Bcl-2. Protein expression levels of Bax, activated caspase-3, -7, -8, and -9, and PARP were increased, while Bcl-2 protein levels were reduced by EGCG treatment. Taken together, EGCG induces B lymphoma cell apoptosis by triggering caspase-dependent intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (death receptor) pathways. These findings suggest that EGCG may be a potential agent for the treatment of B lymphoma.',\n",
       " '5-HTTLPR genotype, asthma, diabetes and late-life depression in an older French population.': '5-HTTLPR genotype, asthma, diabetes and late-life depression in an older French population.\\nOBJECTIVE: Associations between environmental risk factors and depression have been reported to be stronger in people with the S allele of the S/L polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR); however, most studies have focused on adverse life events as a general exposure, and interactions with physical disorders have been less investigated. We therefore investigated associations of asthma and diabetes with depression in an older community population and compared these by 5-HTTLPR genotype. METHODS: A sample of 1617 people aged 65 years and over, from Montpellier, France, were examined for depression, using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview assessments, and a standardised interview was conducted to establish physical health status. Blood samples were also taken for 5-HTTLPR genotype. RESULTS: Depression was significantly associated with asthma and diabetes but not with 5-HTTLPR genotype. After adjustment for age, sex, education and co-residency, the association between asthma and depression did increase in strength and significance across genotype groups (odds ratios in LL, SL and SS genotypes: 1.59 (0.66-3.82), 1.88 (1.05-3.36) and 3.00 (1.26-7.13), respectively) although the interaction term fell below statistical significance (p = 0.29). No modification was observed for diabetes as an exposure.

However, the full potential of using CyTOF can be limited by scarce cell samples. Barcoding strategies developed based on direct labeling of cells using maleimido-monoamide-DOTA (m-DOTA) provide a very useful tool. However, using m-DOTA has some inherent problems, mainly associated with signal intensity. This may be a source of uncertainty when samples are multiplexed. As an alternative or complementary approach to m-DOTA, conjugating an antibody, specific for a membrane protein present on most immune cells, with different isotopes could address the issues of stability and signal intensity needed for effective barcoding. We chose for this purpose CD45, and designed experiments to address different types of cultures and the ability to detect extra- and intra-cellular targets. We show here that our approach provides an useful alternative to m-DOTA in terms of sensitivity, specificity, flexibility, and user-friendliness. Our manuscript provides details to effectively barcode immune cells, overcoming limitations in current technology and enabling the use of CyTOF with scarce samples (for instance precious clinical samples).

       " 'A Multicenter Outcomes Analysis of Children With Severe Rhino/Enteroviral Respiratory Infection*': \"A Multicenter Outcomes Analysis of Children With Severe Rhino/Enteroviral Respiratory Infection*\\nOBJECTIVES:: To investigate the impact of human rhino/enteroviruses on morbidity and mortality outcomes in children with severe viral respiratory infection. DESIGN:: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING:: The ICU, either PICU or cardiac ICU, at three urban academic tertiary-care children's hospitals. PATIENTS:: All patients with laboratory-confirmed human rhino/enteroviruses infection between January 2010 and June 2011. INTERVENTIONS:: We captured demographic and clinical data and analyzed associated morbidity and mortality outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: There were 519 patients included in our analysis. The median patient age was 2.7 years. The median hospital and ICU lengths of stay were 4 days and 2 days, respectively. Thirty-four percent of patients had a history of asthma, and 25% of patients had a chronic medical condition other than asthma. Thirty-two percent of patients required mechanical ventilation. Eleven patients (2.1%) did not survive to hospital discharge. The rate of viral coinfection was 12.5% and was not associated with mortality. Predisposing factors associated with increased mortality included immunocompromised state (p < 0.001), ICU admission severity of illness score (p < 0.001), and bacterial coinfection (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS:: There is substantial morbidity associated with severe respiratory infection due to human rhino/enteroviruses in children. Mortality was less severe than reported in other respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. The burden of illness from human rhino/enteroviruses in the ICU in terms of resource utilization may be considerable.\",\n",
       " 'A biomimetic microfluidic chip to study the circulation and mechanical retention of red blood cells in the spleen.': 'A biomimetic microfluidic chip to study the circulation and mechanical retention of red blood cells in the spleen.\\nRed blood cells (RBCs) are deformable and flow through vessels narrower than their own size. Their deformability is most stringently challenged when they cross micrometer-wide slits in the spleen. In several inherited or acquired RBC disorders, blockade of small vessels by stiff RBCs can trigger organ damage, but a functional spleen is expected to clear these abnormal RBCs from the circulation before they induce such complications. We analyzed flow behavior of RBCs in a microfluidic chip that replicates the mechanical constraints imposed on RBCs as they cross the human spleen. Polymer microchannels obtained by soft lithography with a hydraulic diameter of 25 mum drove flow into mechanical filtering units where RBCs flew either slowly through 5- to 2-mum-wide slits or rapidly along 10-mum-wide channels, these parallel paths mimicking the splenic microcirculation. Stiff heated RBCs accumulated in narrow slits seven times more frequently than normal RBCs infused simultaneously. Stage-dependent retention of Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBCs was also observed in these slits. We also analyzed RBCs from patients with hereditary spherocytosis and observed retention for those having the most altered mechanical properties as determined by ektacytometry. Thus, in keeping with previous observations in vivo and ex vivo, the chip successfully discriminated poorly deformable RBCs based on their distinct mechanical properties and on the intensity of the cell alteration. Applications to the exploration of the pathogenesis of malaria, hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell disease and other RBC disorders are envisioned.Am. J. Hematol., 2015.

The objective of this investigation was to assess the effectiveness of ITNs to prevent malaria in an area of Malawi with moderate pyrethroid resistance.MethodsOne deltamethrin ITN was distributed in the study area for every two individuals in each household plus one extra ITN for households with an odd number of residents. A fixed cohort of 1,199 children aged six to 59 months was seen monthly for one year and at sick visits to measure malaria infection and use of ITNs. Insecticide resistance among malaria vectors was measured. The effect of ITN use on malaria incidence was assessed, adjusting for potential confounders using generalized estimating equations accounting for repeated measures.ResultsThere were 1,909 infections with Plasmodium falciparum over 905 person-years at risk (PYAR), resulting in an observed incidence of 2.1 infections per person-year (iPPY). ITNs were used during 97% of the PYAR. The main vector was Anopheles funestus: mortality in WHO tube assays after exposure to 0.05% deltamethrin was 38% (95% confidence interval (CI) 29 inverted question mark47), and resistance was due to elevated oxidase enzymes. After adjusting for potential confounders, the incidence of malaria infection among ITN users was 1.7 iPPY (95% CI 1.5-2.1) and among non-bed net users was 2.6 iPPY (95% CI 2.0-3.3). Use of ITNs reduced the incidence of malaria infection by 30% (rate ratio 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.8) compared to no bed nets.ConclusionITNs significantly reduced the incidence of malaria infection in children in an area with moderate levels of pyrethroid resistance and considerable malaria transmission. This is the first study to show that ITNs provide protection in areas where pyrethroid-resistant An. funestus is the major malaria vector. Malaria control programmes should continue to distribute and promote ITNs in areas with low to moderate pyrethroid resistance; however, insecticide resistance may intensify further and it is not known whether ITNs will remain effective at higher levels of resistance. There is an urgent need to identify or develop new insecticides and technologies to limit the vulnerability of ITNs to insecticide resistance.',\n",

The biological characterization and dynamics of dormant parasites are not well understood. Here we report that following dihydroartemisinin (DHA) treatment in vitro, a small subset of morphologically dormant parasites was stained with rhodamine 123 (RH), a mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) marker, and persisted to recovery. FACS sorted RH-positive parasites resumed growth at 10,000/well while RH-negative parasites failed to recover at 5 million/well. Furthermore, transcriptional activity for mitochondrial enzymes was only detected in RH-positive dormant parasites. Importantly, after treating dormant parasites with different concentrations of atovaquone, a mitochondrial inhibitor, the recovery of dormant parasites was delayed or stopped. This demonstrates that mitochondrial activity is critical for survival and regrowth of dormant parasites and that RH staining provides a means of identifying these parasites. These findings provide novel paths for studying and eradicating this dormant stage.',\n",

Young males were randomized into session groups of a high-intensity strength training (HI) and a session group of low-intensity strength training with vascular occlusion (LI-BFR). The exercise session consisted in knee extension and bicep curl in 80% 1RM (HI) and 30% 1RM (LI-BFR) with equalized volumes. Blood collection was made before, immediately after and 24 h after each training session. Immunophenotyping was carried out through CD195+ (CCR5) e CD3-CD16+CD56+ (NK) in peripheral blood and analysed by flow cytometry and presented in frequency (%). Peripheral frequency of NK cells showed no significant difference in LI-BFR group in time effect, while a gradual reduction of NK cells was identified in HI group in before-24 h postexercise and after-24 h postexercise comparison. However, significant differences have been found in relative change of NK cells immediately after exercise between sessions. In addition, HI and LI-BFR groups showed a significant reduction in the cells expressed CCR5 during 24 h postsession compared to the postsession, but CCR5 also differed when comparing before-24 h after session in the HI group. No differences were observed amongst the groups. LIO induced CCR5 response similar to the HI session, while the NK cells remained in similar frequency during the studied moments in LI-BFR, but not in HI group, suggesting that local hypoxia created by the blood flow restriction was able to prevent a change in the frequency of peripheral cells and a possible immunosuppression.',\n",

A major bottleneck in the translation of whole-parasite immunization towards routine vaccination is the mode of administration, since high degrees of protection are currently only achieved by intravenous, and not by intradermal or subcutaneous injection of viable parasites. It is known that only a small proportion of subcutaneously administered parasites reach the subsequent liver stage and low parasite liver load was shown to be associated with low protective efficacy. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate whether the liver load following subcutaneous parasite injection could be augmented by co-administration of pro-inflammatory or anti-coagulatory drugs.MethodsIn the C57BL/6 Plasmodium berghei ANKA model, the clinical outcome (time to patent blood stage infection and survival) and relative parasite liver load was assessed in mice infected by subcutaneous or intramuscular sporozoite (SPZ) administration in the presence or absence of histamine and heparin supplementation in comparison to intravenously administered SPZ. In addition, a vaccination experiment was carried out to assess the protective efficacy of an improved, histamine-supplemented subcutaneous immunization regimen.ResultsThe parasite liver load following subcutaneous SPZ administration can be significantly increased by co-administration of histamine and heparin. A dose-dependent relation between parasite liver load and histamine dosage was observed. However, despite a relatively high parasite liver load, the protective efficacy of histamine-supplemented subcutaneous immunization remains inferior as compared to intravenous SPZ administration.ConclusionsHistamine supplementation might facilitate the future development of a non-intravenous whole-parasite vaccine. Further investigations are needed to reveal the effect of histamine supplementation and subcutaneous SPZ administration on the acquisition of protective immunity.',\n",

Recently, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAAm), also known as a \"smart\" polymer, has been proposed as a potential adjuvant for making antibodies and vaccines. This material exhibits efficient delivery, protection against degradation, and preservation of antigen epitopes. In this work, we used both CFA and smart polymer to develop a highly specific murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant truncated histidine rich protein2 (HRP2) of P.falciparum. Our results indicate that the mAbs developed using these adjuvants were able to recognize recombinant HRP2 and native PfHRP2 protein from spent medium. The mAbs generated against recombinant truncated HRP2 showed better sensitivity to the antigen and importantly mAbs generated through PNiPAAm adjuvant were in the range of 108 to 109 M-1 . The mAbs generated through PNiPAAm are very efficient and sensitive in detecting HRP2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such comparison having been made between these two adjuvants and we propose that the smart polymer has huge potential as an alternative to CFA. Additionally, we discuss the utility of the mAbs generated through PNiPAAm for specific diagnosis of malaria caused by P.falciparum.',\n",

Insulin secretory granules (SGs) exist in different functional pools, with young SGs being more mobile and preferentially secreted. However, the principles governing the mobility of age-distinct SGs remain undefined. Using the time-reporter insulin-SNAP to track age-distinct SGs we now show that their dynamics can be classified into three components: highly dynamic, restricted, and nearly immobile. Young SGs display all three components, whereas old SGs are either restricted or nearly immobile. Both glucose stimulation and F-actin depolymerization recruit a fraction of nearly immobile young, but not old, SGs for highly dynamic, microtubule-dependent transport. Moreover, F-actin marks multigranular bodies/lysosomes containing aged SGs. These data demonstrate that SGs lose their responsiveness to glucose stimulation and competence for microtubule-mediated transport over time while changing their relationship with F-actin.',\n",
       " 'Airport malaria: report of four cases in Tunisia.': 'Airport malaria: report of four cases in Tunisia.\\nFour cases of airport malaria were notified for the first time in Tunisia during the summer of 2013. All patients were neighbours living within 2 km of Tunis International Airport. They had no history of travel to malarious countries, of blood transfusion or of intravenous drug use. Although malaria transmission had ceased in Tunisia since 1980, autochthonous infection by local Anopheles mosquitoes was initially considered. However, this diagnostic hypothesis was ruled out due to negative entomological survey and the absence of additional cases.All cases were caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Clinical presentation was severe (important thrombocytopaenia and parasitaemia), because of relatively important delay in diagnosis (average of seven days). This indicates the need to consider malaria while examining airport employees or people living near international airports presenting with fever of unknown origin. It also stresses the need for effective spraying of aircrafts coming from malarious areas.',\n",
       " 'Allergy to sunflower seed and sunflower butter as proposed vehicle for sensitization.': 'Allergy to sunflower seed and sunflower butter as proposed vehicle for sensitization.\\nBACKGROUND: It is hypothesized that household exposure to allergenic proteins via an impaired skin barrier, such as atopic dermatitis, may contribute to the development of IgE sensitization. Household presence of peanut is a risk factor for the development of peanut allergy in children. Sunflower seed butter is a peanut-free alternative to peanut butter, and sunflower seed allergy is an uncommon but reported entity. CASE PRESENTATION: A 3 year old boy presented with oral discomfort that developed almost immediately after he ate sunflower seeds for the first time. He was given a dose of diphenhydramine. Subsequently he vomited, and his symptoms gradually resolved. A similar episode occurred to a commercial snack made with sunflower seed butter. Skin prick testing demonstrated a large positive (10 mm wheal) wheal-and-flare response to a slurry of fresh sunflower seed within 3-4 minutes associated with severe pruritus. This child has an older sibling with confirmed peanut allergy (PNA). After the PNA diagnosis was made, the family home became peanut-free. In lieu of peanut butter, sunflower butter was purchased and eaten frequently by family members, but not by the child reported herein. Subsequent to the episodes above, the child ate a bread roll with visible poppy seeds and developed itchy throat, dyspnea, and urticaria. Epicutaneous skin testing elicited a >10 mm wheal size within 3-4 minutes in response to a slurry of whole poppy seeds and 8 mm to fresh pumpkin seed, which had never been consumed. CONCLUSIONS: A case of sunflower allergy in the context of household consumption of sunflower butter has not yet been reported. We suggest that homes which are intentionally peanut-safe may provide an environment whereby infants with impaired skin barrier are at increased risk of allergy to alternative \"butter\" products being used, via cutaneous exposure to these products preceding oral introduction to the child.',\n",

The study is based on data from the Croatian Health Service Yearbooks. Five chronic and three acute conditions were chosen: diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, asthma and COPD, bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infections and skin infections. The results indicate that the ES in Croatia is overused, and consequently ACSCs are over-represented; 23.3% Croatian citizens visited the ES and around 15% of all diagnoses belonged to the ACSCs, with decreased trend. The leading diagnosis is hypertension, followed by asthma and COPD. For a better understanding of the importance of ACSC within the Croatian context, further research is needed.',\n",

On the basis of that, the antitumor activities of marinacarbolines in a structure-dependent manner were allowed to be unveiled.',\n",

In particular, an increased expression of Wnts and Frizzled receptors was reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and ulcerative colitis to exert both anti- and pro-inflammatory functions regulating the intestinal activated nuclear factor inverted question markB (NF- inverted question markB), TNFa release, and IL10 expression.MethodsTo investigate the role of Wnt pathway in the response of the enteric nervous system (ENS) to inflammation, neurons and glial cells from rat myenteric plexus were treated with exogenous Wnt3a and/or LPS with or without supporting neurotrophic factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epithelial growth factor (EGF), and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). The immunophenotypical characterization by flow cytometry and the protein and gene expression analysis by qPCR and western blotting were carried out.ResultsFlow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining evidenced that enteric neurons coexpressed Frizzled 9 and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) while glial cells were immunoreactive to TLR4 and Wnt3a suggesting that canonical Wnt signaling is active in ENS.Under in vitro LPS treatment, Western blot analysis demonstrated an active cross talk between canonical Wnt signaling and NF- inverted question markB pathway that is essential to negatively control enteric neuronal response to inflammatory stimuli. Upon costimulation with LPS and Wnt3a, a significant anti-inflammatory activity was detected by RT-PCR based on an increased IL10 expression and a downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL1B, and interleukin 6 (IL6). When the availability of neurotrophic factors in ENS cultures was abolished, a changed cell reactivity by Wnt signaling was observed at basal conditions and after LPS treatment.ConclusionsThe results of this study suggested the existence of neuronal surveillance through FZD9 and Wnt3a in enteric myenteric plexus. Moreover, experimental evidences were provided to clarify the correlation among soluble trophic factors, Wnt signaling, and anti-inflammatory protection of ENS.',\n",

Two unusual members of the Merozoite surface protein (MSP)-3 family named MSPDBL1 and MSPDBL2 have been shown to be extrinsically associated to MSP-1 on the parasite surface. In addition to a Secreted Polymorphic Antigen associated with Merozoite (SPAM) domain characteristic of MSP-3 family members, they also contain Duffy Binding Like (DBL) domain and were found to bind to erythrocytes suggesting that they play a role in parasite invasion. Antibody responses to these proteins were investigated in a treatment-re-infection study conducted in an endemic area of Papua New Guinea (PNG) to determine their contribution to naturally acquired immunity. Antibodies to the SPAM domains of MSPDBL1 and MSPDBL2 as well as the DBL domain of MSPDBL1 were found to be associated with protection from P. falciparum clinical episodes. Moreover, affinity purified anti-MSPDBL1 and MSPDBL2 were found to inhibit in vitro parasite growth and had strong merozoite opsonising capacity, suggesting that protection targeting these antigens results from at least 2 different effector mechanisms.

The present study examined the antitumor effect and molecular mechanism of the HDAC inhibitor apicidin in YD-15 human salivary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) cells. The cells were treated with apicidin and cell death was quantified using an MTT assay. Apoptosis and autophagy were measured using flow cytometry, immunoblot analysis and cell staining. Regulation of the signaling pathways was monitored using immunoblot analysis and co-treatment with specific inhibitors. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) was knocked down using specific siRNA. Apicidin significantly inhibited the proliferation of MEC cells. Apicidin also induced apoptosis through the inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT/mTOR signaling and activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), whereas apicidin promoted autophagy through inactivation of the AKT/mTOR signaling. These effects may be mediated by the inhibition of IGF-1R, an upstream regulator of MAPK and AKT/mTOR pathways. These results suggested that apicidin is an attractive chemotherapeutic agent against salivary MEC and may be a good candidate for targeting IGF-1R for cancer therapies.',\n",

However, few studies have been performed to assess the relationship between skin inflammation and ASD exposure. METHODS: Twelve-week-old NC/Nga mice were divided into 6 groups (n = 8 for each group): hydrophilic petrolatum only (control); hydrophilic petrolatum plus ASD (ASD); hydrophilic petrolatum and heat inactivated-ASD (H-ASD); Dermatophagoides farinae extract (Df); Df and ASD (Df + ASD), and; Df and H-ASD (Df + H-ASD). The NC/Nga mice in each group were subjected to treatment twice a week for 4 weeks. We evaluated skin lesions by symptoms, pathologic changes, and serum IgE levels. RESULTS: ASD alone did not induce atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin symptoms. However, Df alone, Df + H-ASD and Df + ASD all induced AD-like symptoms, and dermatitis scores in the group of Df + ASD group were significantly greater than that of the Df group (P = 0.0011 at day 21; and P = 0.017 at day 28). Mean serum IgE was markedly increased in the Df and Df + ASD groups, compared to the ASD and control groups (P < 0.0001), and serum IgE levels in the Df + ASD group were significantly higher compared to the Df group (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: ASD alone did not cause AD-like symptoms in NC/Nga mice. However, AD-like symptoms induced by Df, a major allergen, were enhanced by adding ASD. Although no epidemiological studies have been conducted for the association between ASD and symptoms of dermatitis, our data suggest that it is likely that ASD may contribute to the exacerbation of not only respiratory symptoms, but also skin diseases, in susceptible individuals.',\n",

Particularly, continuous adventitious sounds (CAS) are of clinical interest because they reflect the severity of certain diseases. This study presents a new classifier that automatically distinguishes normal sounds from CAS. It is based on the multi-scale analysis of instantaneous frequency (IF) and envelope (IE) calculated after ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). These techniques have two major advantages over previous techniques: high temporal resolution is achieved by calculating IF-IE and a priori knowledge of signal characteristics is not required for EEMD. The classifier is based on the fact that the IF dispersion of RS signals markedly decreases when CAS appear in respiratory cycles. Therefore, CAS were detected by using a moving window to calculate the dispersion of IF sequences. The study dataset contained 1494 RS segments extracted from 870 inspiratory cycles recorded from 30 patients with asthma. All cycles and their RS segments were previously classified as containing normal sounds or CAS by a highly experienced physician to obtain a gold standard classification. A support vector machine classifier was trained and tested using an iterative procedure in which the dataset was randomly divided into training (65%) and testing (35%) sets inside a loop. The SVM classifier was also tested on 4592 simulated CAS cycles. High total accuracy was obtained with both recorded (94.6% +/- 0.3%) and simulated (92.8% +/- 3.6%) signals. We conclude that the proposed method is promising for RS analysis and classification.',\n",

Upregulation of autophagy in response to specific stimuli can be determined by evaluating autophagic flux. This is achieved by comparing the number of autophagosomes in the absence and presence of lysosomal inhibitors. While the determination of autophagic flux in isolated cells is well-documented, few studies have described its determination in tissues or in vivo. Here, we describe the evaluation of autophagic flux both in vivo and ex vivo in several tissues, after treatment with lysosomal inhibitors and exposure to classical autophagy-inducing stimuli.

Our recent study demonstrated that colistin induces apoptosis in primary chick cortex neurons and PC-12 cells. Although apoptosis and autophagy have different impacts on cell fate, there is a complex interaction between them. Autophagy plays an important role as a homeostasis regulator by removing excessive or unnecessary proteins and damaged organelles. The aim of the present study was to investigate the modulation of autophagy and apoptosis regulation in PC-12 cells in response to colistin treatment. PC-12 cells were exposed to colistin (125-250 mug/mL) and autophagy was detected by visualization of monodansylcadaverine (MDC) labeled vacuoles, LC3 immunofluorescence microscopic examination and western blotting. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, Hoechst 33258 staining and western blotting. Autophagosomes were observed after treatment with colistin for 12 h and the levels of LC3-II gene expression were elevated; both indicated that colistin induced a high level of autophagy. Colistin treatment also led to apoptosis in PC-12 cells and the level of caspase-3 expression increased over the 24-h period. Pretreatment of cells with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) remarkably increased colistin toxicity in PC-12 cells.

The aims of this study were to examine Haemoproteus and Plasmodium diversity based on morphological and molecular data, as well as to explore the concordance between these two approaches, when identifying species. We sampled 1487 birds belonging to 166 species, in localities of the Colombian Andean region at elevations ranging from 2100 to 4000m above sea level. Here, we report twelve morphological parasite species, of which five are undescribed. Thirty parasite cytochrome b lineages are reported, 17 of which for the first time. We provide morphological information and illustrations, as well as, cytochrome b lineages for six morphospecies: Haemoproteus columbae, Haemoproteus witti, Haemoproteus coatneyi, Haemoproteus vireonis, Plasmodium lutzi, and Plasmodium unalis. This is the first report to provide a linkage between morphology and a molecular lineage for H. witti. Cytochrome b gene proved to be useful for species determination as DNA barcoding. Differences in parasite composition between lowlands and highlands in Colombia suggest a replacement of avian Plasmodium fauna. Parasite lineages restricted to either Colombian resident or Nearctic migratory birds were found; but a single lineage common in both has not been recorded in Nearctic non-migratory birds. We generated valuable information by using both morphological and molecular data representing competent host-parasite relationships which are based on observation of gametocytes in circulation; and increased the taxon sampling of avian haemosporidian.',\n",

As vectors of pathogens, Ae. albopictus may create novel epidemiological scenarios in the invaded areas.MethodsHere, the frequency of encounters of Ae. albopictus with the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium and the related Haemoproteus was studied in an area with established populations in northeastern Italy and compared with those from four native mosquito species, Anopheles maculipennis s.l., Culex hortensis, Culex pipiens, and Ochlerotatus caspius. The abdomens of mosquitoes with a recent blood meal were used to identify both the blood meal source and the parasites harboured.Results Aedes albopictus had a clear antropophilic behaviour while An. maculipennis and Oc. caspius fed mainly on non-human mammals. Birds were the most common hosts of Cx. pipiens and reptiles of Cx. hortensis. Parasites were isolated from three mosquito species, with Cx. pipiens (30%) showing the highest parasite prevalence followed by Cx. hortensis (9%) and Ae. albopictus (5%).ConclusionsThese results are the first identifying the avian malaria parasites harboured by mosquitoes in Italy and represent the first evidence supporting that, although Ae. albopictus could be involved in the transmission of avian malaria parasites, the risk of avian malaria parasite spread by this invasive mosquito in Europe would be minimal.',\n",

Important findings arising from pregnancy cohorts are discussed in the present review. These insights have led to revised guidelines on how to minimize disease risks in children, e.g., in the context of chronic immune diseases including allergies and asthma. Moreover, insights from pregnancy cohorts also unveiled a collateral effect of pregnancy on maternal immunity, mirrored by an ameliorated course of certain autoimmune diseases, but also an increased risk of infection with influenza A virus. Future pregnancy cohort studies are still required to close gaps in knowledge on how parameters involved in the developmental origin of health or poor immunity observed in children later in life are operational. We discuss here features that should be covered by future pregnancy cohort studies. Expected insights from such studies will then lay the foundation for biomarker discovery and offer opportunities for interventions to ameliorate adverse immune responses in humans.\",\n",

Probes 2',7'-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH), dihydroethidium (DHE) and MitoSOX red (MSR) are commonly used for detecting ROS by flow cytometry, however these probes lack sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is particularly damaging to mammalian sperm cells. This study reports the synthesis and use of three aryl boronate probes, peroxyfluor-1 (PF1), carboxy peroxyfluor-1 (CPF1) and a novel probe 2(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxy peroxyfluor-1 (EEPF1) in human spermatozoa. PF1 and EEPF1 were found to be effective in detecting H2O2 and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) produced by spermatozoa when stimulated with menadione or 4-hydroxynonenal. EEPF1 was more effective at detection of ROS in spermatozoa than DCFH, DHE and MSR; furthermore it distinguished poorly motile sperm as shown by greater ROS production. EEPF1 should therefore have a significant role in diagnosis of oxidative stress in male infertility, cryopreservation, age, lifestyle and exposure to environmental toxicants.\",\n",

At the erythrocytic stage of infection, IFN-gamma production by CD4(+) T-cells and CD4(+) T-cell help for the B-cell response are required for control and elimination of infected red blood cells. CD4(+) T-cells are also important for controlling Plasmodium pre-erythrocytic stages through the activation of parasite-specific CD8(+) T-cells. However, excessive inflammatory responses triggered by the infection have been shown to drive pathology. Early classical experiments demonstrated a biphasic CD4(+) T-cell response against erythrocytic stages in mice, in which T helper (Th)1 and antibody-helper CD4(+) T-cells appear sequentially during a primary infection. While IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells do play a role in controlling acute infections, and they contribute to acute erythrocytic-stage pathology, it became apparent that a classical Th2 response producing IL-4 is not a critical feature of the CD4(+) T-cell response during the chronic phase of infection. Rather, effective CD4(+) T-cell help for B-cells, which can occur in the absence of IL-4, is required to control chronic parasitemia. IL-10, important to counterbalance inflammation and associated with protection from inflammatory-mediated severe malaria in both humans and experimental models, was originally considered be produced by CD4(+) Th2 cells during infection. We review the interpretations of CD4(+) T-cell responses during Plasmodium infection, proposed under the original Th1/Th2 paradigm, in light of more recent advances, including the identification of multifunctional T-cells such as Th1 cells co-expressing IFN-gamma and IL-10, the identification of follicular helper T-cells (Tfh) as the predominant CD4(+) T helper subset for B-cells, and the recognition of inherent plasticity in the fates of different CD4(+) T-cells.',\n",

In a mouse model of immunity to liver stage Plasmodium infection, CD40 was critical for the full maturation of liver dendritic cells, accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the liver, and protective immunity induced by immunization with the Plasmodium yoelii fabb/f- genetically attenuated parasite. Using mixed adoptive transfers of polyclonal wild-type and CD40-deficient CD8+ T cells into wild-type and CD40-deficient hosts, we evaluated the contributions to CD8+ T cell immunity of CD40 expressed on host tissues including APC, compared with CD40 expressed on the CD8+ T cells themselves. Most of the effects of CD40 could be accounted for by expression in the T cells' environment, including the accumulation of large numbers of CD8+ T cells in the livers of immunized mice. Thus, protective immunity generated during immunization with fabb/f- was largely dependent on effective APC licensing via CD40 signaling.\",\n",

In choroid plexus, epithelial tight junctions and basement membrane lock blood-cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) barrier. Lymphocytic cell data, quantified with multicolour flow-cytometry or immuno-cytochemical methods in sample pairs of lumbar CSF, ventrictricular CSF and peripheral venous blood, are taken from references; similarly, data of thoracic duct chyle and blood sample pairs.

Children living in malaria-endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa are at the highest risk of developing CM, and the long-term effect of CM on neurological function is uncertain. We conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the association between CM and development of long-term neurological impairment. We performed a systematic search through PubMed (including MEDLINE; 1946 to December 2014) and EMBASE (1974 to January 2015) to identify relevant articles. Eligible studies assessed the association between CM and neurological sequelae and were included if they met the criteria allowing a complete extraction of data. Eight studies were included in the final analysis, and in total, 2005 individuals were analysed (cases: n=842, controls: n=1163), most of whom were children. CM was associated with an increased risk of epilepsy (OR 4.68, 95% CI 2.52-8.70), an increased risk of intelligence quotient (IQ) impairment (OR 4.72, 95% CI 0.78-28.49), an increased risk of neurodisabilities (OR 16.16, 95% CI 1.34-195.45), and an increased risk of behavioural disorder (OR 8.47, 95% CI 2.75-26.04).

STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of Medicaid Analytic Extract files from 12 geographically diverse states from 2005-2007. We linked inpatient hospitalization, outpatient, and prescription claims records for children ages 2-18 years with an index hospitalization for asthma to identify those who filled a short-acting beta agonist, oral corticosteroid, or inhaled corticosteroid within 3 days of discharge. We used a multivariable extended Cox model to investigate the association of recommended medication fills and hospital readmission within 90 days. RESULTS: Of 31 658 children hospitalized, 55% filled a beta agonist prescription, 57% an oral steroid, and 37% an inhaled steroid. Readmission occurred for 1.3% of patients by 14 days and 6.3% by 90 days. Adjusting for patient and billing provider factors, beta agonist (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.51, 0.87) and inhaled steroid (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42, 0.85) fill were associated with a reduction in readmission at 14 days. Between 15 and 90 days, inhaled steroid fill was associated with decreased readmission (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77, 0.98). Patients who filled all 3 medications had the lowest readmission hazard within both intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Filling of beta agonists and inhaled steroids was associated with diminished hazard of early readmission. For inhaled steroids, this effect persisted up to 90 days. Efforts to improve discharge care for asthma should include enhancing recommended discharge medication fill rates.',\n",

The first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for asthma revealed putative candidates on nine chromosomal regions in Caucasians, with 17q21 locus being the most widely replicated one. However, there was no replication study for the other loci. This study investigated genetic associations between childhood asthma and autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on eight loci reported in the first GWAS among Hong Kong Chinese. METHODS: 510 asthmatic children and 510 non-allergic controls were recruited. 110 tagging SNPs selected based on r2 >/=0.80 and minor allele frequency >/=0.05 for Han Chinese among all SNPs located 50-kb upstream and downstream of significant autosomal SNPs were genotyped by TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Transcription factor binding of SNPs was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). RESULTS: Asthma was significantly associated with SNPs on 17q21 and 2q14 loci. Twelve SNPs on 17q21 were associated with asthma, with rs6503527 being the most significant SNP. Five SNPs of protein C gene (PROC) on 2q14 were associated with asthma, with rs6755028 being the most significant SNP. Plasma protein C concentrations were higher in asthmatic patients than controls, and five PROC SNPs were associated with plasma protein C concentrations. EMSA showed specific differential binding of rs878461 to nuclear extracts from bronchial epithelial and hepatocarcinoma cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify PROC on 2q14 as a novel candidate for childhood asthma, and replicate the genetic association for 17q21 locus. Rs878461 of PROC may increase asthma susceptibility by altering transcription factor binding. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.',\n",

This study provides information about children's learning and goal attainment related to change in their self-management skills during a diabetes camp. Design and methods. One hundred and thirty-one children completed an evaluation for the first year (year 1), and 68 children completed an evaluation for the second year (year 2). All of the children had type 1 diabetes. During both years, parents provided information about goals for their child before camp started. Children's learning about diabetes self-management, as well as their satisfaction with camp, was assessed at the end of the camp session. In the evaluation for year 2, a goal-setting intervention was also developed, and its effectiveness was assessed through both physicians' and children's reports. Results. Children learned new information during camp about recognizing and managing the signs of hypo- and hyperglycemia and about counting carbohydrates and rotating insulin pump sites. Children were better able to recall their self-management goals in year 2. In terms of benefiting from camp, boys reported learning more than girls about diabetes management, whereas girls were more likely than boys to report that greater opportunities to express feelings were of value. Conclusions. Goal-setting was successful in improving children's recall of their self-management goals. Children benefited from the supportive and educational camp atmosphere. Future research should assess the benefits of camp across multiple camp settings and determine whether educational benefits have long-term effects on children's goal-setting and knowledge and whether these benefits lead to psychosocial improvements.\",\n",

However, it is unclear whether chocolate consumption is associated with risk of DM. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that chocolate consumption is inversely associated with incident DM in the Physicians' Health Study (PHS). DESIGN: We prospectively analyzed data on 18,235 PHS participants who were free of DM at baseline (1997-2001). Chocolate consumption was obtained from a baseline food-frequency questionnaire. Incident DM was ascertained via annual follow-up questionnaires and validated in a subsample by a review of medical records. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs and 95% CIs of DM. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) age at baseline was 66.3 +/- 9.2 y. During a mean follow up of 9.2 y, 1123 men (6.2%) developed DM. For self-reported chocolate consumption of none, 1-3 servings/mo, 1 serving/wk, and >/=2 servings/wk, multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of DM adjusted for lifestyle, clinical, and dietary risk factors including total energy intake were 1.00 (referent), 0.93 (0.79, 1.09), 0.86 (0.72, 1.04), and 0.83 (0.69, 0.99), respectively (P-trend = 0.047). In secondary analyses, the inverse association of chocolate consumption and risk of DM was slightly stronger in subjects without a history of cardiovascular disease or heart failure (P-trend = 0.023). In addition, both age and BMI modified the chocolate-DM relation (P < 0.05 each). CONCLUSION: Our data support an inverse relation of chocolate intake with incident DM, which appears only to apply in younger and normal-body weight men after controlling for comprehensive life styles including total energy consumption.\",\n",

Omalizumab is a humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody currently used to treat severe asthma. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the clinical and immunological effects of omalizumab in ABPA in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Patients with chronic ABPA were randomized to 4-month treatment with omalizumab (750 mg monthly) or placebo followed by a 3-month washout period in a cross-over design. The main endpoint was number of exacerbations. Other clinical endpoints included lung function, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), quality of life and symptoms. In vitro basophil activation to Aspergillus fumigatus extract and basophil FcepsilonR1 and surface-bound IgE levels were assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were recruited with mean total IgE 2314 +/- 2125 IU/mL. Exacerbations occurred less frequently during the active treatment phase compared with the placebo period (2 vs 12 events, P = .048). Mean FeNO decreased from 30.5 to 17.1 ppb during omalizumab treatment (P = .03). Basophil sensitivity to A. fumigatus and surface-bound IgE and FcepsilonR1 levels decreased significantly after omalizumab but not after placebo.

It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options. PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of 2 years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base. The guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities deemed most important by the working group and is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for diagnosing and managing AR. The recommendations outlined in the guideline are not intended to represent the standard of care for patient management, nor are the recommendations intended to limit treatment or care provided to individual patients. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life. The development group also made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing. Findings of AR consistent with an allergic cause include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. (2) Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. (3) Clinicians should assess patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR for, and document in the medical record, the presence of associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media. (4) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls. The panel recommended against (1) clinicians routinely performing sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR and (2) clinicians offering oral leukotriene receptor antagonists as primary therapy for patients with AR. The panel group made the following options: (1) Clinicians may advise avoidance of known allergens or may advise environmental controls (ie, removal of pets; the use of air filtration systems, bed covers, and acaricides [chemical agents formulated to kill dust mites]) in patients with AR who have identified allergens that correlate with clinical symptoms. (2) Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR. (3) Clinicians may offer combination pharmacologic therapy in patients with AR who have inadequate response to pharmacologic monotherapy. (4) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction in patients with AR with nasal airway obstruction and enlarged inferior turbinates who have failed medical management. (5) Clinicians may offer acupuncture, or refer to a clinician who can offer acupuncture, for patients with AR who are interested in nonpharmacologic therapy. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the use of herbal therapy for patients with AR.',\n",

New methods for measuring BP are replacing mercury sphygmomanometry in many clinics. We examined the utility of different BP measurement techniques in predicting subclinical TOD in adolescents and young adults. METHODS: Participants in a study of the cardiovascular effects of obesity and type 2 diabetes were evaluated (N=677, 18+/-3.3 years, 35% male, 60% non-White, 30% with type 2 diabetes). We measured adiposity, laboratory data, left ventricular mass, carotid intima-media thickness, and pulse wave velocity. BP was measured three times by mercury sphygmomanometry (BPm), using an oscillometric device (BPo), and by arterial tonometry to measure central aortic BP (BPc). Participants were stratified as normotensive, prehypertensive, or hypertensive. RESULTS: The prevalence of HT in this cohort with a mean BMI of 31 was the highest on BPo measurement (16%), followed by BPm (11%) and BPc (9%; P</=0.001) measurements. BPm was the most consistent in differentiating left ventricular mass and pulse wave velocity among participants in the prehypertensive group as compared with the normotensive and hypertensive groups. Mercury BP measurement was also more sensitive and specific at predicting greater left ventricular mass, pulse wave velocity, and carotid thickness compared with other BP measurement techniques in logistic regression. CONCLUSION: We conclude that mercury sphygmomanometry should remain the gold standard for evaluation of HT and the risk for TOD in adolescents and young adults.',\n",

PLT transfusion provides a treatment option for these patients. However it is currently unclear if, and to what extent, P2Y12 inhibitors influence PLT function of donor PLTs and if patients taking these medications are likely to benefit from PLT transfusions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of blood and plasma of clopidogrel-, prasugrel-, and ticagrelor-treated patients on PLT function of blood from healthy volunteers in flow cytometry, light transmission aggregometry, and multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA). RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that clopidogrel had no and prasugrel had only mild effects on donor PLT function, but the reversible P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor completely abolished adenosine diphosphate-mediated PLT activation in all assays tested. We further show that ticagrelor itself and not elevated adenosine concentrations in patient plasma were responsible for the observed effects. Moreover, we show that a modified MEA assay could provide a simple and rapid tool to allow determination of whether patients are likely to benefit from PLT transfusions. CONCLUSION: Our results provide novel insights into potential differences between the P2Y12 inhibitors on donor PLT function in an in vitro setting, which may provide implications for future PLT transfusion strategies in these patients.',\n",
       " 'Compartmentalization of GABA Synthesis by GAD67 Differs between Pancreatic Beta Cells and Neurons.': 'Compartmentalization of GABA Synthesis by GAD67 Differs between Pancreatic Beta Cells and Neurons.\\nThe inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is synthesized by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in neurons and in pancreatic beta-cells in islets of Langerhans where it functions as a paracrine and autocrine signaling molecule regulating the function of islet endocrine cells. The localization of the two non-allelic isoforms GAD65 and GAD67 to vesicular membranes is important for rapid delivery and accumulation of GABA for regulated secretion. While the membrane anchoring and trafficking of GAD65 are mediated by intrinsic hydrophobic modifications, GAD67 remains hydrophilic, and yet is targeted to vesicular membrane pathways and synaptic clusters in neurons by both a GAD65-dependent and a distinct GAD65-independent mechanism. Herein we have investigated the membrane association and targeting of GAD67 and GAD65 in monolayer cultures of primary rat, human, and mouse islets and in insulinoma cells. GAD65 is primarily detected in Golgi membranes and in peripheral vesicles distinct from insulin vesicles in beta-cells. In the absence of GAD65, GAD67 is in contrast primarily cytosolic in beta-cells; its co-expression with GAD65 is necessary for targeting to Golgi membranes and vesicular compartments. Thus, the GAD65-independent mechanism for targeting of GAD67 to synaptic vesicles in neurons is not functional in islet beta-cells.

Spotty calcification within atherosclerotic plaque is associated with cardiovascular events. The aim of the present study was to assess the correlationship of immature EPCs levels and spotty calcification in CAD patients. In 224 CAD patients studied, 76 were with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 102 were with unstable angina pectoris (UAP), and 46 were with stable angina pectoris (SAP). The levels of OCN positive (OCN+ ) EPCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. The status of spotty calcification was determined by cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA). OCN+ EPCs and calcium deposits were significantly increased in acute coronary artery syndrome (ACS) when compared with those in SAP patients. Also positive correlation was revealed between the number of OCN+ EPCs and frequency of spotty calcification, levels of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in AMI and UAP patients. In summary, the number of OCN+ EPCs is positively related to the frequency of spotty calcification in ACS patients. Serum hs-CRP and serum alkaline levels are thought to contribute to the elevation of OCN+ EPCs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.',\n",

Little is known about PfPKG\\'s activation mechanism. Here we report that the carboxyl cyclic nucleotide binding domain functions as a \"gatekeeper\" for activation by providing the highest cGMP affinity and selectivity. To understand the mechanism, we have solved its crystal structures with and without cGMP at 2.0 and 1.9 A, respectively. These structures revealed a PfPKG-specific capping triad that forms upon cGMP binding, and disrupting the triad reduces kinase activity by 90%. Furthermore, mutating these residues in the parasite prevents blood stage merozoite egress, confirming the essential nature of the triad in the parasite. We propose a mechanism of activation where cGMP binding allosterically triggers the conformational change at the alphaC-helix, which bridges the regulatory and catalytic domains, causing the capping triad to form and stabilize the active conformation.',\n",

This study describes four distinct asthma endotypes identified via a purely data-driven method. Our method was specifically designed to integrate blood gene expression and clinical biomarkers in a way that provides new mechanistic insights regarding the different asthma endotypes. For example, we describe metabolic syndrome-induced systemic inflammation as an associated factor in three of the four asthma endotypes. Context provided by the clinical biomarker data was essential in interpreting gene expression patterns and identifying putative endotypes, which emphasizes the importance of integrated approaches when studying complex disease etiologies. These synthesized patterns of gene expression and clinical markers from our research may lead to development of novel serum-based biomarker panels.',\n",

METHODS: Anti-Gal and anti-non-Gal IgGs were analyzed in serial plasma samples of NHP recipients after PITX by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using synthetic Gal and by flow cytometry using alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene knockout (GTKO) porcine endothelial cells, respectively. Anti-non-Gal IgG was detected in some recipients after PITX. The specificity of anti-non-Gal IgG was investigated by two-dimensional electrophoresis of the protein extract from GTKO porcine endothelial cells, Western blot analysis of recipient pre- and post-PITX plasma, and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, revealing albumin, a non-glycosylated protein in the serum supplement of the islets solution, as a putative antigen for anti-non-Gal IgG. The binding of IgG antibodies to human albumin (HA), bovine albumin (BA), porcine albumin (PA), and Gal was compared by ELISA in pre- and post-PITX plasma samples of 30 NHP recipients subjected to intraportal PITX, which were grouped according to the use of CD40-CD154 blockade and sirolimus. RESULTS: One of the immunoblot-matched spots was identified as BA by mass spectrometry. By ELISA, the plasma used in the immunoblot analysis revealed strong IgG binding to BA and PA, but not to HA. Anti-PA, anti-BA, and anti-Gal antibodies in NHP recipients 1 month after PITX were detected in 5 (100%), 3 (60%), and 5 (100%), respectively, of the 5 recipients receiving various immunosuppression (IS) without CD40-CD154 blockade (group I) and in 0 (0%), 0 (0%), and 4 (16%), respectively, of the 25 recipients receiving IS with CD40-CD154 blockade and sirolimus (group II). This finding revealed significant differences between the groups (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0011 and P = 0.0013, respectively). Interestingly, among 15 recipients achieving graft survival longer than 1 month in group II, anti-PA IgG was detected in only 1 recipient (6.7%) 180 days after PITX. However, an increase in anti-Gal IgG was detected in 7 recipients (46.7%) despite maintenance IS with anti-CD154 and sirolimus. This result indicates that anti-Gal IgG is more frequently induced than anti-PA IgG (P = 0.0352). Moreover, induction IS with anti-CD154 and sirolimus suppressed anti-Gal IgG, but not anti-PA and anti-BA IgG, responses in sensitized recipients given a repeat transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: In NHP recipients of PITX, anti-PA and anti-BA IgG antibodies are elicited by porcine serum included as a supplement in porcine islet preparation. IS including CD40-CD154 blockade and sirolimus suppresses these antibody responses in naive recipients, but not in sensitized recipients. The elicitation of anti-xenogenic albumin antibodies, a humoral response to a model protein antigen, is distinct from that of anti-Gal antibodies, a response to carbohydrate antigen.',\n",

The aggregation of human IAPP (hIAPP) into amyloid deposits is associated with type II diabetes. Substantial evidence suggests that the interaction of anionic membranes with hIAPP may facilitate peptide aggregation and the N-terminal 1~19 fragment (IAPP1-19) plays an important role in peptide-membrane interaction. As a first step to understand how structural differences between human and rat IAPP peptides in membrane may influence the later oligomerization process, we have investigated the structures and orientations of hIAPP1-19 and the less toxic rIAPP1-19 (i.e. the H18R mutant of hIAPP1-19) monomers in anionic POPG bilayers by performing replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. On the basis of ~20-mus REMD simulations started from a random coil conformation of the peptide placed in water, we find that unfolded h(r)IAPP1-19 can insert into the bilayers and the membrane-bound peptide stays mainly at the lipid head-tail interface. hIAPP1-19 displays higher propensity to adopt helical conformations than rIAPP1-19, especially in the L12~L16 region. The helical conformation is oriented parallel to the bilayer surface and buried in the membrane 0.3~0.8 nm below the phosphorus atoms, consistent with previous electron paramagnetic resonance data. The helical conformation is an amphiphilic helix with its hydrophilic and hydrophobic faces pointing respectively to the lipid head and tail regions. The H18R substitution enhances the electrostatic interactions of IAPP1-19 with membrane, while weakens the intra-peptide interactions crucial for helix formation, thus leading to lower helix propensity of rIAPP1-19. Implications of our simulation results on the membrane-mediated IAPP1-19 oligomerization are discussed.',\n",

METHODS: Seventy six asthmatic children aged 6-14 years, allergic to house dust mites were randomized to a double-blinded trial comparing montelukast therapy to a matching placebo. We studied following end-points: the reduction in the ICS dose, the frequency of exacerbations, lung function, asthma control test score, and the change from baseline in FEV1 during a standardized exercise treadmill challenge. ICS dose was adjusted in a stepwise fashion to determine the lowest dose necessary to control asthma symptoms. RESULTS: We showed that children with baseline value of FeNO above 31 ppb and well controlled asthma symptoms on low doses of ICS, benefit the most from additive therapy with montelukast; their cumulative ICS dose is lower than in children treated with ICS only. Also, the addition of montelukast to regular treatment in asthmatic children resulted in a signi fi cant reduction in the frequency of exacerbations and EIB protection. CONCLUSION: It is reasonable to add montelukast to ICS therapy in asthmatic children during the school year, to lower cumulative ICS dose in children with well controlled asthma symptoms, as well as to reduce number of exacerbations, and to achieve better control of EIB.

CD14+CD16+ monocytes, a mature subpopulation of peripheral blood monocytes, are key mediators of HIV neuropathogenesis. Infected CD14+CD16+ monocyte transmigration across the blood brain barrier mediates HIV entry into the brain and establishes a viral reservoir within the CNS. Despite successful antiretroviral therapy, continued influx of CD14+CD16+ monocytes, both infected and uninfected, contributes to chronic neuroinflammation and the development of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Drug abuse increases extracellular dopamine in the CNS. Once in the brain, CD14+CD16+ monocytes can be exposed to extracellular dopamine due to drug abuse. The direct effects of dopamine on CD14+CD16+ monocytes and their contribution to HIV neuropathogenesis are not known. In this study, we showed that CD14+CD16+ monocytes express mRNA for all five dopamine receptors by qRT-PCR and D1R, D5R and D4R surface protein by flow cytometry. Dopamine and the D1-like dopamine receptor agonist, SKF38393, increased CD14+CD16+ monocyte migration that was characterized as chemokinesis. To determine whether dopamine affected cell motility and adhesion, live cell imaging was used to monitor the accumulation of CD14+CD16+ monocytes on the surface of a tissue culture dish. Dopamine increased the number and the rate at which CD14+CD16+ monocytes in suspension settled to the dish surface. In a spreading assay, dopamine increased the area of CD14+CD16+ monocytes during the early stages of cell adhesion. In addition, adhesion assays showed that the overall total number of adherent CD14+CD16+ monocytes increased in the presence of dopamine. These data suggest that elevated extracellular dopamine in the CNS of HIV infected drug abusers contributes to HIV neuropathogenesis by increasing the accumulation of CD14+CD16+ monocytes in dopamine rich brain regions.',\n",

Weight loss is the most effective approach to reducing diabetes risk. It is a research priority to identify factors that may enhance weight loss success, particularly among those at risk for diabetes. This analysis explored the relationships between self-efficacy, weight loss, and dietary fat intake among adults at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Methods. This pilot, site-randomized trial was designed to compare group-based Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention delivery by YMCA staff to brief counseling alone (control) in 92 adults at risk for diabetes (BMI >/= 24 kg/m2, >/= 2 diabetes risk factors, and a random capillary blood glucose of 110-199 mg/dl). Self-efficacy was measured using the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle questionnaire. Data were collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. A paired t test was used to determine within-group changes in self-efficacy and weight at 6 and 12 months. Using a fitted model, we estimated how much of an increase in self-efficacy was related to a 5% weight reduction at 6 and 12 months. Results. Self-efficacy was associated with a 5% reduction in baseline weight at 6 and 12 months but was not related to fat intake. Conclusion. These findings suggest that it is important to assess the level of self-efficacy when counseling adults at high risk for diabetes about weight loss. Certain aspects of self-efficacy seem to play a greater role, depending on the stage of weight loss.',\n",

In particular, changes in appetite and dietary intake, that lead to weight gain and changes in body composition are considered undesirable. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether 10 days oral corticosteroid therapy in adults with asthma causes changes in leptin, appetite, dietary intake, body weight and body composition. METHODS: Double-blinded, placebo controlled randomised cross-over trial of 10 days prednisolone (50mg) in adults with stable asthma (n=55) (ACTRN12611000562976). Pre and post assessment included spirometry, body weight, body composition measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and bioelectrical impedance analysis, appetite measured using a validated visual analogue scale and dietary intake assessed using 4-day food records. Leptin was measured as a biomarker of appetite and eosinophils as an adherence biomarker. Outcomes were analysed by generalised linear mixed models. RESULTS: Subject adherence was confirmed by a significant decrease in blood eosinophils (x109/L) following prednisolone compared to placebo (Coef. -0.29 95% CI: (-0.39,-0.19) p<0.001).

This channel protein facilitates transport of water and several solutes across the cell membrane. In order to better elucidate the fundamental interactions between PfAQP and its permeants and among the permeants, I conducted over three microseconds in silico experiments of atomistic models of the PfAQP-membrane system to obtain the free-energy profiles of five permeants (erythritol, water, glycerol, urea, and ammonia) throughout the amphipathic conducting pore of PfAQP. The profiles are analyzed in light of and shown to be consistent with the existent in vitro data. The binding affinities are computed using the free-energy profiles and the permeant fluctuations inside the channel. On this basis, it is predicted that erythritol, a permeant of PfAQP itself having a deep ditch in its permeation passageway, inhibits PfAQP's functions of transporting water and other solutes with an IC50 in the range of high nanomolars. This leads to the possibility that erythritol, a sweetener generally considered safe, may inhibit or kill the malarial parasite in vivo without causing undesired side effects.

Viable nucleated cells were consecutively stained for SP and ALDH activity and with antibodies against the CD45, CD34, and CD117 antigens. RESULTS: The SP and ALDH+ populations could reliably be measured simultaneously. The median sizes of the SP and the ALDH+ populations were 0.85 and 3.3% of CD45dim cells, respectively. There was no overlap between the SP and ALDH+ populations. Cells that were ALDH+ expressed CD34 and CD117, but SP cells were negative for these markers. The ALDH+ cell content correlated with CD34+ cell content (p < 0.001) and with CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (GM; p = 0.03) but not with total CFUs. SP did not correlate with CD34+, CFU-GM, or total CFU. CONCLUSIONS: We show that simultaneous detection of the CD34, SP, and ALDH+ cells is clearly feasible using only small amounts of CB. In CB, ALDH+, and CD34+ cells are overlapping populations distinctly separated from the SP population. The difference in relation to the capacity for colony growth between ALDH+ and SP underlines that they define different cell populations.',\n",

       " 'Fitness cost of resistance for lumefantrine and piperaquine-resistant Plasmodium berghei in a mouse model.': 'Fitness cost of resistance for lumefantrine and piperaquine-resistant Plasmodium berghei in a mouse model.\\nBackgroundThe evolution of drug-resistant parasites is a major hindrance to malaria control, and thus understanding the behaviour of drug-resistant mutants is of clinical relevance. The study aimed to investigate how resistance against lumefantrine (LU) and piperaquine (PQ), anti-malarials used as partner drugs in artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), impacts parasite fitness. This is important since resistance to ACT, the first-line anti-malarial regimen is increasingly being reported.MethodsThe stability of Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain that was previously selected for LU and PQ resistance was evaluated using the 4-day assay and established infection test in mice. Fitness cost of resistance was determined by comparing parasites proliferation rates in absence of drug pressure for the drug-exposed parasites between day 4 and 7 post-infection (pi), relative to the wild-type. Statistical analysis of data to compare mean parasitaemia and growth rates of respective parasite lines was carried out using student inverted question marks t-test and one-way analysis of variance, with significance level set at p<0.05.ResultsDuring serial passaging in the absence of the drug, the PQ-resistant parasite maintained low growth rates at day 7 pi (mean parasitaemia, 5.6% +/- 2.3) relative to the wild-type (28.4% +/- 6.6), translating into a fitness cost of resistance of 80.3%. Whilst resistance phenotype for PQ was stable, that of LU was transient since after several serial passages in the absence of drug, the LU-exposed line assumed the growth patterns of the wild-type.ConclusionsThe contrasting behaviour of PQ- and LU-resistance phenotypes support similar findings which indicate that even for drugs within the same chemical class, resistance-conferred traits may vary on how they influence parasite fitness and virulence. Resistance-mediating polymorphisms have been associated with less fit malaria parasites. In the absence of drug pressure in the field, it is therefore likely that the wild-type parasite will out-compete the mutant form. This implies the possibility of reintroducing a drug previously lost to resistance, after a period of suspended use. Considering the recent reports of high failure rates associated with ACT, high fitness cost of resistance to PQ is therefore of clinical relevance as the drug is a partner in ACT.',\n",

However, for the time-being, the clinical and scientific application of the HistaFlow(R) technique remains limited. This study aims at verifying the reliability of the HistaFlow(R) as an instrument to quantify IgE-mediated basophil responses to drugs, i.e. rocuronium, which are believed to be less potent basophil activators than large proteinaceous allergens. Ten patients and three exposed control individuals were included in this study. Each subject underwent in vitro basophil activation tests (HistaFlow(R)) with 0.16 and 1.6 mmol/L rocuronium. Patients showed an activation of basophils ranging from 11 to 86% of CD63 positive basophils and a median histamine release per cell from 68 to 100% after stimulation with an optimal concentration of 1.6 mmol/L rocuronium. For the control individuals no activation was demonstrable. This study confirms that the HistaFlow(R) technique is a reliable tool to study histamine release by individual cells in response to drugs. Although the HistaFlow(R) technique will probably not add to the diagnostic management of rocuronium allergy, our findings suggest that the technique could constitute an important asset for future studies on the pathomechanism(s) of immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions.

The free radicals, both the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), are derived from both endogenous sources (mitochondria, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum, phagocytic cells etc.) and exogenous sources (pollution, alcohol, tobacco smoke, heavy metals, transition metals, industrial solvents, pesticides, certain drugs like halothane, paracetamol, and radiation). Free radicals can adversely affect various important classes of biological molecules such as nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, thereby altering the normal redox status leading to increased oxidative stress. The free radicals induced oxidative stress has been reported to be involved in several diseased conditions such as diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's disease-PD, Alzheimer's disease-AD and Multiple sclerosis-MS), cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerosis and hypertension), respiratory diseases (asthma), cataract development, rheumatoid arthritis and in various cancers (colorectal, prostate, breast, lung, bladder cancers).

Following the limited results for conventional therapies, novel therapeutic agents are under investigation. Among the putative new molecules, gallic acid (GA) represents a promising new anticancer drug. The anticancer effect of this drug has been based on its antioxidant effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the toxic effects of GA on the T98G human glioblastoma cell line and its capacity to modulate the expression of microRNAs targeting the genes involved in tumor growth and invasion. Cytotoxicity, clonogenic ability and cell migration after GA treatment were tested. Moreover, the expression of miRNAs that target genes for antioxidant mitochondrial enzymes (mir-17-3p), p-21 protein (mir-21-5p) and ATM (mir-421-5p) was determined by qRT-PCR. The results confirmed in the T98G cells the anti-proliferative effect of GA reported for other glioma cell lines and showed that the miRNA expression changes depending on GA concentrations. Different GA concentrations can determine a protective or a toxic effect on tumor cells. Thus, the key for GA to induce a specific anticancer action is to use an optimal concentration that avoids these twin effects.',\n",

We investigated the role of sensitisation in the association between GDF and allergic conditions. A population-based sample of 788 adults from the West Sweden Asthma Study completed questionnaires and skin prick tests. After adjustment for confounders GDF exposure was associated with a doubled risk of sensitisation to mites, but not other allergens. Mite sensitisation also modified the effect of GDF on asthma. In mite-sensitised subjects GDF was associated with physician-diagnosed asthma, adjusted OR 2.9 (1.2-7.2) and wheeze, OR 2.4 (1.1-5.3). In non-mite-sensitised subjects the corresponding ORs were 1.1 (0.5-2.6) and 0.6 (0.3-1.3). GDF was independently associated with eczema regardless of mite sensitisation, but not with rhinitis. These novel findings suggest that components of GDF may act as adjuvants that facilitate sensitisation to mites, and that mite-sensitised individuals may be especially susceptible to inhalant occupational exposures.

Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of gout have been reported, they included self-reported gout cases in which clinical information was insufficient. Therefore, the relationship between genetic variation and clinical subtypes of gout remains unclear. Here, we first performed a GWAS of clinically defined gout cases only. METHODS: A GWAS was conducted with 945 patients with clinically defined gout and 1213 controls in a Japanese male population, followed by replication study of 1048 clinically defined cases and 1334 controls. RESULTS: Five gout susceptibility loci were identified at the genome-wide significance level (p<5.0x10-8), which contained well-known urate transporter genes (ABCG2 and SLC2A9) and additional genes: rs1260326 (p=1.9x10-12; OR=1.36) of GCKR (a gene for glucose and lipid metabolism), rs2188380 (p=1.6x10-23; OR=1.75) of MYL2-CUX2 (genes associated with cholesterol and diabetes mellitus) and rs4073582 (p=6.4x10-9; OR=1.66) of CNIH-2 (a gene for regulation of glutamate signalling). The latter two are identified as novel gout loci. Furthermore, among the identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we demonstrated that the SNPs of ABCG2 and SLC2A9 were differentially associated with types of gout and clinical parameters underlying specific subtypes (renal underexcretion type and renal overload type). The effect of the risk allele of each SNP on clinical parameters showed significant linear relationships with the ratio of the case-control ORs for two distinct types of gout (r=0.96 [p=4.8x10-4] for urate clearance and r=0.96 [p=5.0x10-4] for urinary urate excretion). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide clues to better understand the pathogenesis of gout and will be useful for development of companion diagnostics.',\n",

       " 'Gram-negative bacterial carriage in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis is not associated with more severe inflammation.': 'Gram-negative bacterial carriage in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis is not associated with more severe inflammation.\\nBACKGROUND: We have previously demonstrated that persistent symptoms following functional endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is associated with Gram-negative bacterial carriage. Mechanisms for this remain unknown. We wished to determine whether Gram-negative carriage in patients with CRS with nasal polyposis is associated with a more severe inflammatory phenomenon. METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-seven patients with CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) previously phenotyped for genetic association studies with questionnaire, serum biomarkers, and endoscopically-obtained swab cultures were studied. These were separated according to the presence (wGN) or absence (sGN) of Gram-negative bacterial carriage; demographic parameters and available serum biomarkers (complete blood count [CBC], total immunoglobulin E [IgE]) were then compared. Subgroup analysis for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (GNwPa) and non-Pseudomonas Gram-negative bacteria (GNsPs) was performed in order to explore potentially differential roles of these bacteria. RESULTS: Gram-negative bacterial carriage was not associated with a difference in demographic parameters or serum biomarkers. However, P. aeruginosa carriage was associated with a higher self-reported incidence of asthma (GNwPa 79%, sGN 57%; p = 0.048). Interestingly, serum IgE was increased in the non-Pseudomonas Gram-negative population (GNsPs: 338 IU/mL, sGN: 195 IU/mL; p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: CRSwNP patients colonized with Gram-negative bacteria have a similar pattern of inflammation as assessed by serum biomarkers to those colonized with Gram-positive ones. Gram-negative bacteria may contribute to development of a T helper 2 (Th2) phenotype via other mechanisms, possibly via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated interleukin 33 (IL-33) production. Differences in phenotype associated with Pseudomonas species carriage suggest a different behavior than other Gram-negative bacteria, supporting their importance as disease modifiers in CRSwNP.',\n",

Anti-CD3 administration induces transient T cell depletion both in preclinical and in clinical studies. Notably, the said depletion mainly affects CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells. Moreover, type 1 diabetes reversal in preclinical models is accompanied by the selective expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells, which are fundamental for the long-term maintenance of anti-CD3-mediated tolerance. The mechanisms that lead to this immune-shaping by affecting mainly CD4+ T effector cells while sparing CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells have still to be fully elucidated. This study shows that CD3 expression levels differ from one T cell subset to another. CD4+Foxp3- T cells contain higher amounts of CD3 molecules than do CD4+Foxp3+ and CD8+ T cells in both mice and humans. The said differences correlate with the anti-CD3-mediated immune resetting that occurs in vivo after anti-CD3 administration in diabetic NOD mice. Additionally, transcriptome analysis demonstrates that CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells are significantly less responsive than are CD4+Foxp3- T cells to anti-CD3 treatment at a molecular level. Thus, heterogeneity in CD3 expression seems to confer to the various T cell subsets differing susceptibility to the in vivo tolerogenic anti-CD3-mediated modulation. These data shed new light on the molecular mechanism that underlies anti-CD3-mediated immune resetting and thus may open new opportunities to improve this promising treatment.',\n",

Immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) are a class of IFNgamma-dependent proteins that are essential for cell autonomous immunity to numerous intracellular pathogens. However, it is currently unknown whether IRGs modulate responses during malaria. We have used the Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) model, in which mice develop experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), to study the roles of IRGM1 and IRGM3 in immunopathology. Induction of mRNA for Irgm1 and Irgm3 was found in the brains and spleens of infected mice at times of peak IFNgamma production. Irgm3-/-, but not Irgm1-/- mice, were completely protected from the development of ECM, and this protection was associated with decreased induction of inflammatory cytokines, as well as decreased recruitment and activation of CD8+ T cells within the brain. Although antigen-specific proliferation of transferred CD8+ T cells was not diminished compared to WT recipients following PbA infection, T cells transferred into Irgm3-/- recipients showed a striking impairment of effector differentiation. Decreased induction of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4), as well as enhanced mRNA expression of type-I IFNs were found in the spleens of Irgm3-/- mice at day 4 post-infection. Together, these data suggest that protection from ECM pathology in Irgm3-/- mice occurs due to impaired generation of CD8+ effector function. This defect is non-intrinsic to CD8+ T cells. Instead, diminished T cell responses most likely result from defective initiation of inflammatory responses in myeloid cells.',\n",

The overarching combination of experimental research and theoretical analysis in a systems biology approach can unravel mechanisms of complex interactions between pathogens and the human immune system. Taking into account spatial information is especially important in the context of infection, since the migratory behavior and spatial interactions of cells are often decisive for the outcome of the immune response. Spatial information is provided by image and video data that are acquired in microscopy experiments and that are at the heart of an image-based systems biology approach. This review demonstrates how image-based systems biology improves our understanding of infection processes. We discuss the three main steps of this approach-imaging, quantitative characterization, and modeling-and consider the application of these steps in the context of studying infection processes. After summarizing the most relevant microscopy and image analysis approaches, we discuss ways to quantify infection processes, and address a number of modeling techniques that exploit image-derived data to simulate host-pathogen interactions in silico.

Clinical history, which can help differentiate related clones (low grade B cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation/LBCL-PD) from unrelated ones (plasma cell proliferative disorder (PCPD) with an unrelated B cell clone), is often unavailable in referred specimens. We sought to identify morphologic or phenotypic features that would help predict the significance of these clones in the absence of history. We included only cases with identical light chain B and plasma cell clones, as determined by 6-color flow cytometry with additional DNA ploidy analysis, in which the relationship between clones could be established by review of medical records. There were 26 cases; 18 were related (14 were Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia) and eight were unrelated (seven multiple myeloma). Features seen exclusively in LBCL-PD include CD19+/CD45+ clonal plasma cell phenotype (66.7%, P = 0.0022) and morphologic features such as paratrabecular bone marrow involvement, increased mast cells, and plasma cells surrounding B-cell nodules.

We examined the impact of postoperative VTE on patients undergoing pituitary surgery. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was evaluated for patients undergoing pituitary resection from 2002 to 2010. Patient demographics, comorbidities, length of stay, hospital charges, and postoperative complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients who underwent pituitary surgery developed a VTE. Patients who underwent pituitary surgery that developed VTE were older (55.9 +/- 15.2 years) than those who did not develop VTE (50.1 +/- 17.2 years) (P = 0.002). VTE occurred at a significantly higher rate in patients with coagulopathy, peripheral vascular disorder, and weight loss (P < 0.05). VTE was associated with increased rates of postoperative neurological, pulmonary, cardiac, urinary, renal, hemorrhage, fluid and electrolytes, diabetes insipidus, and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea complications (P < 0.01)-as well as increased mortality rate (P < 0.001), length of stay (P < 0.001), and cost of care (P < 0.001).

Therefore, rapid and simple specimen processing strategies can directly enable more sensitive LFIA by purifying and concentrating biomarkers. Here, a binary reagent system is presented for concentrating analytes from a larger volume specimen to improve the malaria LFIA's limit of detection (LOD). The biomarker enrichment process utilizes temperature-responsive gold-streptavidin conjugates, biotinylated antibodies, and temperature-responsive magnetic nanoparticles. The temperature-responsive gold colloids were synthesized by modifying the citrate-stabilized gold colloids with a diblock copolymer, containing a thermally responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAm) segment and a gold-binding block composed of NIPAAm-co-N,N-dimethylaminoethylacrylamide. The gold-streptavidin conjugates were synthesized by conjugating temperature-responsive gold colloids with streptavidin via covalent linkages using carbodiimide chemistry chemistry. The gold conjugates formed half-sandwiches, gold labeled biomarker, by complexing with biotinylated antibodies that were bound to Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a malaria antigen. When a thermal stimulus was applied in conjunction with a magnetic field, the half-sandwiches and temperature-responsive magnetic nanoparticles that were both decorated with pNIPAAm formed large aggregates that were efficiently magnetically separated from human plasma.

In the present study, tissue samples of 233 wild passerine birds found dead in Eastern Austria were examined by in situ hybridization (ISH) and partial cytochrome B gene sequence analysis for the presence, abundance and taxonomic assignment of Plasmodium spp. In 34 cases (14.6 %), ISH yielded a positive result with large numbers of developmental stages in different cell types of the spleen, liver, brain and lung. The abundance of the tissue stages, which was comparable to fatal cases of avian malaria in penguins, suggested a major contribution to the cause of death. Genetic analysis revealed infections with representatives of three different valid species of Plasmodium, Plasmodium elongatum, Plasmodium lutzi and Plasmodium vaughani. Genetically identical parasite lineages had been found in a previous study in penguins kept in the Vienna zoo, providing evidence for the role of wild birds as reservoir hosts. Further, this study provides evidence that several species of Plasmodium are able to abundantly proliferate in endemic wild birds ultimately resulting in mortalities.',\n",

For this purpose, after the physicochemical characterization of SLN, the uptake by those immunocompetent fish cells was evaluated using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Concomitantly, the uptake of 6-COUM loaded SLN was compared with that achieved with 6-COUM loaded pectin microparticles (MPs), which were selected as a competitor of the delivery carriers. After SLN and MP physicochemical characterization, the results demonstrated that SAF-1 cells were able to internalize high percentages of 6-COUM SLNs when incubated for 4, 8 and 24h, with the highest SLN concentration tested (10mug/ml). The ability of HK leucocytes to internalize SLN was also found to vary depending on both incubation time and SLN concentration. The highest values of HK leucocytes internalizing SLN particles (around 16%) were detected at the maximum SLN concentration (20mug/ml) at incubation times of 4 or 8h. Conversely, HK leucocytes were unable to internalize MPs at any tested concentration and incubation time. A possible mechanism explaining the uptake into cells is proposed. The present work constitutes the first approximation to consider SLN as nanocarriers for delivering biologically active substances to fish.',\n",

IL-21 and IL-21R of peripheral blood samples and/or thyroid tissues from AITD patients and healthy controls were analyzed by ELISA, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, the mRNA and protein of inflammatory cytokines of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon recombinant human IL-21 (rhIL-21) stimulation were detected. There was an increased serum concentration of IL-21 in untreated GD and HT patients, and IL-21+CD3+CD8-T cells were significantly increased in PBMCs of HT patients compared with healthy volunteers. The IL-21 mRNA expression in PBMCs increased dramatically in GD and HT patients, and marked augmentations of IL-21 and IL-21R mRNA in thyroid tissues of HT patients were observed. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the expression of IL-21R protein in HT thyroid cells and lymphocytes. In vitro, PBMCs from GD cultured with rhIL-21 induced increased IL-17A but decreased IL-4 production, while from HT stimulated by rhIL-21 induced augmented production of IFN-gamma. In conclusion, the expression of IL-21 and IL-21R were up-regulated in AITD and may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease through augmenting aberrant immune cascade.\",\n",

The lower limits of detection and quantification vary amongst the assays used throughout the world, which may affect the ability of mathematical models to accurately estimate the liver-to-blood inoculum (LBI) values that are used to judge the efficacy of pre-erythrocytic vaccine and drug candidates.MethodsSamples were collected around the time of onset of pre-patent parasitaemia from subjects who enrolled in two different CHMI clinical trials. Blood samples were tested for Plasmodium falciparum 18S rRNA and/or rDNA targets by different NAT methods and results were compared. Methods included an ultrasensitive, large volume modification of an established quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay that achieves detection of as little as one parasite/mL of whole blood.ResultsLarge volume qRT-PCR at the University of Washington was the most sensitive test and generated quantifiable data more often than any other NAT methodology. Standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) performed at the University of Oxford and standard volume qRT-PCR performed at the University of Washington were less sensitive than the large volume qRT-PCR, especially at 6.5 days after CHMI. In these trials, the proportion of participants for whom LBI could be accurately quantified using parasite density value greater than or equal to the lower limit of quantification was increased. A greater improvement would be expected in trials in which numerous subjects receive a lower LBI or low dose challenge.ConclusionsStandard qPCR and qRT-PCR methods with analytical sensitivities of ~20 parasites/mL probably suffice for most CHMI purposes, but the newly developed large volume qRT-PCR may be able to answer specific questions when more analytical sensitivity is required.',\n",

Inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) is a consensus term used to describe a group of disorders previously called vocal cord dysfunction, paradoxical vocal fold motion, and numerous other terms. Exercise--ILO can impair one's ability to exercise, can be confused with asthma, leading to unnecessary prescription of asthma controller and rescue medication, and results in increased healthcare resource utilization including (rarely) emergency care. It is characterized by episodic shortness of breath and noisy breathing that generally occurs at high work rates. The present diagnostic gold standard for all types of ILO is laryngoscopic visualization of inappropriate glottic or supraglottic movement resulting in airway narrowing during a spontaneous event or provocation challenge. A number of different behavioral techniques, including speech therapy, biofeedback, and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, may be appropriate to treat individual patients. A consensus nomenclature, which will allow for better characterization of patients, coupled with new diagnostic techniques, may further define the epidemiology and etiology of ILO as well as enable objective evaluation of therapeutic modalities.\",\n",

The aim of the present study was to examine the induction and mechanism of HeLa cell apoptosis by euptox A. The apoptosisinducing effect of the euptox A on HeLa cells was examined by MTT assay. The underlying mechanism was analyzed by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR. Flow cytometry results suggested that euptox A effectively inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells, arrested the cell cycle transition from S to G2/M phase, did not continue to complete the cell cycle activity (mainly from 4 times and mitosis), and induced cell proliferation. The RT-qPCR detection results showed that euptox A induced apoptosis by improving the gene expression level of apoptotic proteases such as caspase-10 in HeLa cells. Its mechanism of action was associated with the upregulation of apoptotic gene expression and arresting of the cell cycle.',\n",
       " 'Inflammasome Activity in Non-Microbial Lung Inflammation.': 'Inflammasome Activity in Non-Microbial Lung Inflammation.\\nThe understanding of interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines in inflammatory disease has rapidly developed, due in part to the discovery and characterization of inflammasomes, which are multi-subunit intracellular protein scaffolds principally enabling recognition of a myriad of cellular stimuli, leading to the activation of caspase-1 and the processing of IL-1beta and IL-18. Studies continue to elucidate the role of inflammasomes in immune responses induced by both microbes and environmental factors. This review focuses on the current understanding of inflammasome activity in the lung, with particular focus on the non-microbial instigators of inflammasome activation, including inhaled antigens, oxidants, cigarette smoke, diesel exhaust particles, mineral fibers, and engineered nanomaterials, as well as exposure to trauma and pre-existing inflammatory conditions such as metabolic syndrome. Inflammasome activity in these sterile inflammatory states contribute to diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive disease, acute lung injury, ventilator-induced lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer.',\n",

Here, we study the impact of SiaLeX ligand on the interactions of the liposomes with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) using flow cytometry, spectrofluorimetry and confocal microscopy. Liposomes composed of egg phosphatidylcholine/yeast phosphatidylinositol/1,2-dioleoyl glycerol ester of melphalan, 8:1:1, by mol, and varying percent of lipophilic SiaLeX-conjugate were labelled with BODIPY-phosphatidylcholine. The increase in SiaLeX content in liposomes led to a proportional increase in their uptake by cytokine-activated cells as opposed to non-activated HUVEC: for 10%-SiaLeX liposomes, binding avidity and overall accumulation increased 14- and 6-fold, respectively. The early stages of intracellular traffic of targeted liposomes in the activated cells were monitored by co-localisation with the trackers of organelles. Endocytosis of SiaLeX-liposomes occurred mostly via clathrin-independent pathways, which does not contradict the available literature data on E-selectin localisation in the plasma membrane. Using dual fluorescence labelling, with rhodamine labelled phospholipid and calcein encapsulated at self-quenching concentration, we found that SiaLeX-liposomes undergo rapid (within minutes) internalisation by activated HUVEC accompanied by the disruption of liposomes; non-activated cells consumed negligible dose of liposomes during at least 1.5h. Our data evidence the selective effect of SiaLeX-formulations on activated endothelial cells and indicate their potential to intracellular delivery of melphalan lipophilic prodrug.',\n",

As alternative approach, using LC/MS guided purification, we previously obtained a series of novel natural terpene-conjugated curcuminoids from turmeric, and some of them exhibited even more potent anti-cancer activity against multiple types of cancer cells than curcumin. The purpose of this follow-up study was designed to decipher the mechanisms involved in anti-cancer activity of these novel curcumin analogues. Apoptosis was evaluated using sub-G1 analysis by flow cytometry and Cell Death ELISA Kit. Changes of protein expression were analyzed by western blotting. RNA interference was employed to inhibit expression of specific protein. We found that bisabolocurcumin ether (T1) and demethoxybisabolocurcumin ether (T2) were able to trigger much stronger apoptosis induction in multiple types of cancer cells than curcumin, which was attributed to persistent and stronger ROS generation. ROS induction by T1 resulted in activation of p38/H2AX axis and p53. Inhibition of p38/H2AX led to a significant reduction of apoptosis, whereas inactivation of p53 caused a dramatically enhanced H2AX phosphorylation and apoptosis induction, suggesting activation of p38/H2AX contributed to apoptosis induction by T1, whereas p53 activation protected novel curcumins-induced apoptosis via suppression of H2AX activation. Our findings provide mechanistic support for the potential use of terpene-conjugated curcuminoids as a novel class of cancer chemopreventive agents. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the impact of the PNPLA3 rs738409 SNP on liver enzymes, metabolic indexes, and maternal and neonatal outcomes in 200 GD patients enrolled in a lifestyle intervention. DESIGN: In a randomized trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design, exercise significantly improved maternal and neonatal outcomes in GD patients. Effects of the G allele on metabolic and liver indexes and maternal and neonatal outcomes were evaluated in these patients. RESULTS: At the end of the trial, fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values were significantly lower and liver enzymes significantly higher in PNPLA3 G-allele carriers. In a multiple regression model, the G allele was associated directly with aspartate aminotransferase (beta = 2.60; 95% CI: 0.99, 4.20), alanine aminotransferase (beta = 3.70; 95% CI: 1.78, 5.62), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (beta = 3.70; 95% CI: 0.80, 6.60) and inversely with insulin (beta = -2.01; 95% CI: -3.24, -0.78) and HOMA-IR (beta = -0.39; -0.64, -0.14) values at the end of the trial.

In the present study, we found that MYO6 is over-expressed in lung cancer tissues and associated with lung cancer progression, particularly lymph node metastasis. To investigate its functions in lung cancer cells, we generated recombinant lentivirus taking shRNA of MYO6. Using two lung cancer cell lines, A549 and 95D, we found that Lv-shMYO6 could infect lung cancer cells with high efficiency and down-regulate MYO6 on both mRNA and protein levels. After knock-down of MYO6, the proliferation rates of lung cancer cells were decreased significantly. The colony formation ability of MYO6 silenced lung cancer cells was also impaired with reduced colony numbers and fewer cells per colony. Flow cytometry showed that cell cycle progression was stuck at the G0 /G1 phase, especially at the sub-G1 phase, which represents apoptotic cells. Moreover, knock-down of MYO6 down-regulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Further experiments using another shRNA of MYO6 confirmed the above results. These results suggest that MYO6 is crucial in maintaining cell cycle and cell growth of lung cancer cells. MYO6 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer treatment.

The impact of benzene exposure on the complex microenvironment of HSCs and HPCs remains elusive. This study aims to investigate the mechanism linking benzene exposure to targeting HSCs and HPCs using phenotypic and clonogenic analyses. Mouse bone marrow (BM) cells were exposed ex vivo to the benzene metabolite, 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ), for 24h. Expression of cellular surface antigens for HSC (Sca-1), myeloid (Gr-1, CD11b), and lymphoid (CD45, CD3e) populations were confirmed by flow cytometry. The clonogenicity of cells was studied using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assay for multi-lineage (CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM) and single-lineage (CFU-E, BFU-E, CFU-G, and CFU-M) progenitors. 1,4-BQ demonstrated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in mouse BM cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased (p<0.05) following 1,4-BQ exposure. Exposure to 1,4-BQ showed no significant effects on CD3e+ cells but reduced the total counts of Sca-1+, CD11b+, Gr-1+, and CD45+ cells at 7 and 12muM (p<0.05). Further, the CFU assay showed reduced (p<0.05) clonogenicity of 1,4-BQ-treated cells. 1,4-BQ mediated CFU-dependent cytotoxicity by significantly inhibiting colony growth for CFU-E, BFU-E, CFU-G, and CFU-M starting at a low concentration of exposure (5muM); whereas for the CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM, the inhibition of colony growth was remarkable only at 7 and 12muM of 1,4-BQ, respectively. Taken together, 1,4-BQ mediated lineage-related cytotoxicity in mouse HPCs, demonstrating greater toxicity in single-lineage progenitors than in those of multi-lineage.',\n",

In this report, we aimed to (i) systematically review the evidence regarding the long-term efficacy of omalizumab in patients with persistent uncontrolled allergic asthma, and to (ii) discuss the cost-effectiveness evidence published for omalizumab in this patient population. A comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs; >/=52 weeks) was performed, and six studies met our final inclusion criteria (n = 2,749). Omalizumab was associated with significant improvements in quality of life and the Global Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness. Omalizumab also allowed patients to completely withdraw from inhaled corticosteroid therapy and did not increase the overall incidence of adverse events. However, there was insufficient evidence that omalizumab reduced the incidence of exacerbations, and the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab varied across studies. Our data indicated that omalizumab use for at least 52 weeks in patients with persistent uncontrolled allergic asthma was accompanied by an acceptable safety profile, but it lacked effect on the asthma exacerbations. Use of omalizumab was associated with a higher cost than conventional therapy, but these increases may be cost-effective if the medication is used in patients with severe allergic asthma.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the absolute and specific antibody titres to VP1 antigens of the gut-trophic enteroviruses, echovirus 30 and Sabin 1 poliovirus, in asthmatic and non-asthmatic children. METHODS: Recombinant polypeptides representing the VP1 capsid antigens of echovirus 30 and Sabin poliovirus 1 were produced. Their ability to bind IgG1 antibodies from the plasma of asthmatic (n=45) and non-asthmatic (n=29) children were quantitated by immunoassays that incorporated immunoabsorptions to remove cross-reactivity. RESULTS: The IgG1 antibody titres and prevalence of antibody binding to echovirus 30 were significantly lower for asthmatic children compared to controls (P < 0.05), and inversely correlated with total IgE levels for the whole study population (r = -0.262; P < 0.05). There was no difference in the prevalence and titre between groups to the VP1 antigen of Sabin poliovirus. Anti-tetanus toxoid titres measured for comparison did not correlate with anti-echovirus or poliovirus, but correlated with anti-rhinovirus titres in controls but not asthmatics, where the titres were higher for the asthmatic group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The associations of lower antibody titres of asthmatic children to echovirus reported here and those of our previous findings of a heightened response to rhinovirus suggest a dichotomy where respiratory enterovirus infection/immunity increases the probability of developing asthma, and enteric infections lower the risk.

Lunasin inhibits NF-kappaB activation and thus pro-inflammatory cytokine and mediator production in macrophages. In this study we demonstrate that lunasin can effectively suppress allergic airway inflammation in two murine models of asthma. In an OVA+Alum sensitization model, intranasal lunasin treatment at the time of OVA challenges significantly reduced total cells counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and eosinophilia, peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltration, goblet cell metaplasia and airway IL-4 production. In an OVA+LPS intranasal sensitization model, lunasin treatment either at the time of sensitization or challenge has similar effects in suppress allergic airway inflammation including significantly reduced total cell and eosinophil counts in BAL fluid, inflammatory gene Fizz1 expression in the lung, and IL-4 production by OVA re-stimulated cells from mediastinal lymph nodes. We further show that intranasal instillation of OVA+lunasin significantly increases OVA-specific regulatory T cell (Treg) accumulation in the lung comparing to OVA only treatment. Taken together, our results suggest lunasin as an anti-inflammatory agent can be potentially used in asthma therapy or as an adjuvant to enhance the induction of antigen-specific Tregs and thus boost the efficacy of allergy immunotherapy.',\n",

A knowledge, attitude and practice study was also carried out. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS ver. 11.5. RESULTS: A total of 2875 malaria cases were recorded, with highest and lowest numbers in 2007 and 2010, respectively. The number of cases had a decreasing trend from 1022 cases in 2006 to 114 cases in 2010. The main causative parasitic agent was Plasmodium vivax. Blood examination rate and slide positive rate were also decreased from 39.5% and 4.3% in 2006 to 15.6% and 1.4% in 2010, respectively. Most of people interviewed in the KAP study had a good knowledge about malaria transmission and symptoms but their use of the bed net for prevention was low (35%). CONCLUSION: Malaria incidence had significant reduction during the study years. The main reason for this may be due to changing environmental condition for Anopheline breeding and survival because of drought. Another reason may be integration of vector management by using long lasting insecticide treated bed nets, active case detection and treatment by implementation of mobile teams and increasing in financial sources of malaria control program.

With the use of a modified polymerase chain reaction, 20/65 (30.8%) of free-ranging birds and 26/46 (56.5%) of flamingos were classified as positive for this parasite genus. DNA sequencing of the parasite cytochrome b gene in positive samples demonstrated that eight species of free-ranging birds were infected with five different Plasmodium spp. cytochrome b lineages, and all positive Chilean flamingos were infected with Plasmodium spp. cytochrome b lineages most closely related to organisms in the Novyella subgenus. These results show that Chilean flamingos may harbor subclinical malaria infections more frequently than previously estimated, and that they may have increased susceptibility to some Plasmodium species.',\n",
       " 'Molecular detection of human Plasmodium species in Sabah using PlasmoNex TM multiplex PCR and hydrolysis probes real-time PCR.': 'Molecular detection of human Plasmodium species in Sabah using PlasmoNex TM multiplex PCR and hydrolysis probes real-time PCR.\\nBackgroundMalaria is a vector borne-parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of the infective female Anopheles mosquitoes. Five Plasmodium species have been recognized by World Health Organization (WHO) as the causative agents of human malaria. Generally, microscopic examination is the gold standard for routine malaria diagnosis. However, molecular PCR assays in many cases have shown improvement on the sensitivity and specificity over microscopic or other immunochromatographic assays.MethodsThe present study attempts to screen 207 suspected malaria samples from patients seeking treatment in clinics around Sabah state, Malaysia, using two panels of multiplex PCRs, conventional PCR system (PlasmoNexTM) and real-time PCR based on hydrolysis probe technology. Discordance results between two PCR assays were further confirmed by sequencing using 18S ssu rRNA species-specific primers.ResultsOf the 207 malaria samples, Plasmodium knowlesi (73.4% vs 72.0%) was the most prevalent species based on two PCR assays, followed by Plasmodium falciparum (15.9% vs 17.9%), and Plasmodium vivax (9.7% vs 7.7%), respectively. Neither Plasmodium malariae nor Plasmodium ovale was detected in this study. Nine discrepant species identification based on both the PCR assays were further confirmed through DNA sequencing. Species-specific real-time PCR only accurately diagnosed 198 of 207 (95.7%) malaria samples up to species level in contrast to PlasmoNexTM assay which had 100% sensitivity and specificity based on sequencing results.ConclusionsMultiplex PCR accelerate the speed in the diagnosis of malaria. The PlasmoNexTM PCR assay seems to be more accurate than real-time PCR in the speciation of all five human malaria parasites. The present study also showed a significant increase of the potential fatal P. knowlesi infection in Sabah state as revealed by molecular PCR assays.',\n",

METHOD: Study was conducted to determine the Surveillance of malaria in South Punjab by microscopy and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULT: samples out of 100 patients were found positive for malarial parasites. One patient was found with mixed infection, whereas P. falciparum and P. vivax infections were detected in 17 and 22 patients, respectively. In nested PCR, genus-specific primers for Plasmodium species. in round 1 and species-specific primers for P. falciparum and P. vivax in round 2 were used. By the application of PCR 41% were found to be infected by Plasmodium spp. Among Plasmodium positive patients: mixed, P. falciparum and P. vivax infection were detected in 10, 15 and 16 patients, respectively. Thirty nine microscopically positive patients confirmed to have Plasmodium spp. One negative by PCR, 2 microscopically negative patients had shown Plasmodium spp. infection (P. falciparum and P. vivax) by PCR. In total samples, P. falciparum, P. vivax and mixed infection accounted for 36.6%, 39.0% and 24.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Microscopy was found deficient for interpretation of mixed infections, low parasitaemia, and species specific diagnosis. The sensitivity, specificity and efficacy of nested PCR was calculated 95%, 98% and 97%, respectively, showing PCR as a more effective and efficient diagnostic tool for malaria.',\n",
       " 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis EspB protein suppresses interferon-gamma-induced autophagy in murine macrophages.': 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis EspB protein suppresses interferon-gamma-induced autophagy in murine macrophages.\\nBACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) persists within immature phagosomes by preventing their maturation into phagolysosomes. Although the early secretory antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) system 1 (ESX-1) secretion-associated protein B (EspB) of Mtb is strongly linked to immunogenicity and virulence of this organism, its mechanism of action remains largely unclear. This study aimed to investigate EspB effects on autophagy in murine ANA-1 macrophage cells. METHODS: EspB gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from Mtb H37Rv genomic DNA to express recombinant EspB protein. Levels of autophagic markers, including Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B-I and -II), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and total STAT1 in ANA-1 cells treated with EspB proteins were assessed by Western blotting. In addition, autophagic vacuoles were detected by fluorescence microscopy. Finally, IFN-gammaR1 expression was evaluated by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. RESULTS: EspB gene was expressed in Escherichia coli cells to yield a soluble N-terminal glutatione S-transferase tag fusion protein used in subsequent experiments. Preincubation with EspB significantly suppressed autophagosome formation and LC3B expression induced by interferon (IFN)-gamma stimulation, in a dose-dependent manner. These results were confirmed by the reduced incorporation of monodansylcadaverine, a marker for the acidic compartment of autolysosomes, after treatment with EspB. Interestingly, we found that IFN-gamma receptor 1 mRNA and protein levels were decreased in EspB-stimulated ANA-1 cells in comparison with untreated cells. Finally, EspB protein also inhibited IFN-gamma-activated STAT1 phosphorylation, thereby downmodulating macrophage responsiveness to IFN-gamma. CONCLUSION: EspB inhibits autophagosome formation in murine macrophages, at least in part by downregulating IFN-gamma receptor 1 expression. Overall, EspB should be considered a relevant factor in the pathogenesis of mycobacterial infections in humans.',\n",

Thus, we performed quantitative real time PCR to investigate the mRNA expression of Th2 associated genes as well as genes that are involved in IgE immunoglobulin-class switch. Additionally, we used ELISA, western blot and flow cytometry (FACS) to analyse protein concentrations of Th1, Th2 and Th17 specific transcription factors and cytokines and the Th2 chemokine, Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine/chemokine ligand 17 (TARC/CCL17) by ELISA RESULTS: Mice lacking NFATc1 in CD4+ T cells display a significant reduction in lung Th2 and Th17 as well as an increase of Th1 cells in an experimental asthma model. Additionally, Batf gene, a recently described transcription factor of the Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation as well as a key T and B transcription factor involved in the IgE immunoglobulin class switch, was found decreased in the lungs of these mice. As a consequence, serum OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 levels were found significantly decreased after allergen exposure and in the absence of NFATc1 in T cells in experimental allergic asthma CONCLUSIONS & CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Targeting NFATc1 in T lymphocytes ameliorated the allergic trait in the airways of NFATc1fl/fl xCD4Cre mice.

       " 'Nerve Growth Factor Potentiates Nicotinic Synaptic Transmission in Mouse Airway Parasympathetic Neurons.': 'Nerve Growth Factor Potentiates Nicotinic Synaptic Transmission in Mouse Airway Parasympathetic Neurons.\\nIn autonomic ganglia, acetylcholine is released from preganglionic nerve terminals and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on postganglionic neurons, resulting in a brief, short-lived synaptic potential (fast excitatory postsynaptic potential or fEPSP). Although nerve growth factor (NGF) is known to affect sensory and sympathetic nerves, especially during development, little is known regarding its effect on parasympathetic nerves, especially on adult neurons. Elevated levels of NGF and NGF-mediated neural plasticity may have a role in airway diseases such as asthma and COPD. In this study, we characterize the composition and response of nAChRs in parasympathetic neurons located in lower airways of mice and note the effects of NGF on fEPSPs and on nicotinic currents. Based on immunohistochemical staining, nAChRs are made up of alpha-3 and beta-4 subunits; in addition, TrkA, the receptor for NGF, is also expressed by the neurons. Vagus nerve evoked fEPSPs and inward currents evoked by a nicotinic receptor agonist (1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium) were increased by NGF. NGF also affected the action potential afterhyperpolarization. These studies were done in mice, a species that is routinely used to study airway diseases such as asthma, where the allergen-induced contraction of airway smooth muscle has a well-defined parasympathetic cholinergic component.',\n",

Network-based metaanalysis of four independent microarray studies identified the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A), a transcription factor associated with gluconeogenesis and diabetes, as a central regulatory hub gene up-regulated in blood of PD patients. In parallel, the polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), involved in the stabilization and mRNA translation of insulin, was identified as the most down-regulated gene. Quantitative PCR assays revealed that HNF4A and PTBP1 mRNAs were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in blood of 51 PD patients and 45 controls nested in the Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease. These results were confirmed in blood of 50 PD patients compared with 46 healthy controls nested in the Harvard Biomarker Study. Relative abundance of HNF4A mRNA correlated with the Hoehn and Yahr stage at baseline, suggesting its clinical utility to monitor disease severity. Using both markers, PD patients were classified with 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Longitudinal performance analysis demonstrated that relative abundance of HNF4A and PTBP1 mRNAs significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in PD patients during the 3-y follow-up period. The inverse regulation of HNF4A and PTBP1 provides a molecular rationale for the altered insulin signaling observed in PD patients. The longitudinally dynamic biomarkers identified in this study may be useful for monitoring disease-modifying therapies for PD.\",\n",

Although rapid immunochromatographic tests (RDTs) have been deployed to diagnose diseases such as malaria, the extreme climate conditions encountered in these regions compounded with the discrepancies in test manufacturing have yielded varying results, so that more innovative and robust technologies are sought. Devoid of antibodies and thermally sensitive materials, we present a robust, colorimetric diagnostic platform for the detection of a malarial biomarker, Plasmodium falciparum Histidine-Rich Protein 2 (PfHRP-II). The assay exploits the optical properties of gold nanoparticles, covalently coupling them to a Ni(II)NTA recognition element specific for PfHRP-II. In the presence of the recombinant malarial biomarker (rcHRP-II), the Ni(II)NTA AuNPs begin to crosslink and aggregate in as little as one minute, triggering a red-to-purple color change in solution. To increase assay sensitivity and platform stability suitable for low-resource regions, the Ni(II)NTA AuNPs were assembled with varying spacer ligands in a mixed monolayer presentation. When assembled with a negatively charged Peg4-thiol ligand, the Ni(II)NTA AuNPs demonstrate low nanomolar limits of rcHRP-II detection in physiological concentrations of human serum albumin and maintain excellent stability at 37 degrees C when stored for four weeks. Detection of the malaria biomarker is also measured by capturing and processing images of aggregated gold nanoparticles with a smartphone camera. By utilizing a smartphone camera and image processing application, there is no significant difference in assay sensitivity and rcHRP-II limit of detection in comparison to a spectrophotometer, further making this diagnostic platform applicable for use in low-resource regions.',\n",

However, limited data are available on the association between nut intake and all-cause mortality. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to test the hypothesis that nut consumption is inversely associated with the risk of all-cause mortality. DESIGN: In this prospective cohort study in 20,742 male physicians, we assessed nut intake between 1999 and 2002 via a food-frequency questionnaire and ascertained deaths through an endpoint committee. We used Cox regression to estimate multivariable-adjusted HRs for death according to nut consumption. In secondary analyses, we evaluated associations of nut consumption with cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 9.6 y, there were 2732 deaths. The mean (+/-SD) age at baseline was 66.6 +/- 9.3 y. Median nut consumption was 1 serving/wk. Multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) were 1.0 (reference), 0.92 (0.83, 1.01), 0.85 (0.76, 0.96), 0.86 (0.75, 0.98), and 0.74 (0.63, 0.87) for nut consumption of never or <1 serving/mo, 1-3 servings/mo, 1 serving/wk, 2-4 servings/wk, and >/=5 servings/wk, respectively (P-linear trend < 0.0001), after adjustment for age, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, exercise, prevalent diabetes and hypertension, and intakes of energy, saturated fat, fruit and vegetables, and red meat. In a secondary analysis, results were consistent for cardiovascular disease mortality but only suggestive and non-statistically significant for coronary artery disease and cancer mortality.

Each has been shown to have distinct LPS detoxifying activity and may play a role in the development of endotoxin tolerance. In search of the origin of complement, a functional homolog of complement C3 involved in opsonization has been identified in horseshoe crabs. Horseshoe crabs possess anti-microbial peptides able to bind to acyl chains or phosphate groups/saccharides of endotoxin, LPS. Complement activity as a whole is detectable in marine invertebrates. These are also a source of anti-microbial peptides with potential pharmaceutical applicability. Investigating the locality for the production of complement pathway proteins and their role in modulating cellular immune responses are emerging fields. The significance of local synthesis of complement components is becoming clearer from in vivo studies of parenchymatous disease involving specifically generated, complement-deficient mouse lines. Complement C3 is a central component of complement activation. Its provision by cells of the myeloid lineage varies. Their effector functions in turn are increased in the presence of anti-microbial peptides. This may point to a potentiating range of activities, which should serve the maintenance of health but may also cause disease. Because of the therapeutic implications, this review will consider closely studies dealing with complement activation and anti-microbial peptide activity in acute inflammation (e.g., dialysis-related peritonitis, appendicitis, and ischemia).',\n",

We have shown that HIV is associated with a prothrombotic monocyte phenotype, which can be partially mitigated by statin therapy. We therefore explored the relationship between oxidized LDL particles and monocyte activation. METHODS: We performed phenotypic analysis of monocytes using flow cytometry on fresh whole blood in 54 patients with HIV and 24 controls without HIV. Plasma levels of oxLDL, soluble CD14, IL-6, soluble CD163 were measured by ELISA. In vitro experiments were performed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Plasma levels of oxLDL were significantly increased in HIV-infection compared to controls (60.1 units vs 32.1 units, p<0.001). Monocyte expression of the oxLDL receptors, CD36 and Toll-like receptor 4, were also increased in HIV. OxLDL levels correlated with markers of monocyte activation, including soluble CD14, TF expression on inflammatory monocytes, and CD36. In vitro, stimulation with oxLDL, but not to LDL, resulted in expansion of inflammatory monocytes and increased monocyte expression of TF, recapitulating the monocyte profile we find in HIV disease. CONCLUSIONS: OxLDL may contribute to monocyte activation and further study in the context of HIV disease is warranted.',\n",

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 costimulatory pathway on immunotolerance induction in mouse pancreatic islet transplantation. METHODS: Full-length mouse PD-L1 cDNA was subcloned into pShuttle-GFP-CMV(-) shuttle plasmid. The product was cut by certain restriction endonuclease and ligated with pAdxsi vector. The adenovirus bone plasmid was transformed into DH5alpha-competent bacteria. After linearization, the recombined adenovirus DNA was transfected into 293 cells for package and amplification. Streptozotocin was injected intraperitoneally into C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) mouse to induce diabetic model recipient. Recipients were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group A was the control. Group B and group C were injected with Ad-EGFP and Ad-PD-L1 through the tail vein, respectively, 1 day before islet transplantation. The 300 to 400 islets of DBA/2 (H-2(d)) were transplanted into the renal subcapsular space of the diabetic model recipient. We monitored and analyzed the blood glucose levels and the survival time of grafts after transplantation. RESULTS: Recombinant adenovirus Ad-PD-L1 had high efficiency expression of PD-L1 in recipient mouse. The blood glucose concentration of mice in the Ad-PD-L1 gene treatment group was obviously lower than that of the control and Ad-EGFP treatment groups and was stable and kept within the normal range at post-transplant 21 days. The survival time of grafts in the Ad-PD-L1 group (27.6 +/- 3.5 days) was significantly longer than in the control (7.8 +/- 0.33 days) and Ad-EGFP groups (7.6 +/- 0.59 days), P < .01. Mixed lymphocyte response showed a specific decrease reaction of recipient lymphocyte vs donor lymphocyte. Flow cytometry detection showed that unsplit cells occupied 90% of recipient mouse lymphocytes, but unsplit cells among normal C57BL/6 mouse lymphocytes without Ad-PD-L1 gene treatment were 51 in the control group. The differences between them were significant (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Recombinant adenovirus Ad-PD-L1 has been successfully constructed. In mouse pancreatic islet transplantation, it can suppress the activation of recipient T lymphocyte through the PD-1/PD-L1 costimulatory pathway, and significantly prolong the survival time of grafts.',\n",

While recent evidences suggest that CD8+ T cells may play an important role during the erythrocytic phase of infection by eliminating parasites, CD8+ T cells might also contribute to modulate the host response through production of regulatory cytokines. Thus, the role of CD8+ T cells during blood-stage malaria is unclear. Here, we report the phenotypic profiling of CD8+ T cells subsets from patients with uncomplicated symptomatic P. vivax malaria.MethodsBlood samples were collected from 20 Plasmodium vivax-infected individuals and 12 healthy individuals. Immunophenotyping was conducted by flow cytometry. Plasma levels of IFN- inverted question mark, TNF- inverted question mark and IL-10 were determined by ELISA/CBA. Unpaired t-test or Mann inverted question markWhitney test was used depending on the data distribution.Results P. vivax-infected subjects had lower percentages and absolute numbers of CD8+CD45RA+ and CD8+CD45RO+ T cells when compared to uninfected individuals (p inverted question mark inverted question mark inverted question mark0.0002). A significantly lower absolute number of circulating CD8+CD45+CCR7+ cells (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.002) was observed in P. vivax-infected individuals indicating that infection reduces the number of central memory T cells. Cytokine expression was significantly reduced in the naive T cells from infected individuals compared with negative controls, as shown by lower numbers of IFN- inverted question mark+ (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.001), TNF- inverted question mark+ (p inverted question mark< inverted question mark0.0001) and IL-10+ (p inverted question mark< inverted question mark0.0001) CD8+ T cells. Despite the reduction in the number of CD8+ memory T cells producing IFN- inverted question mark (p inverted question mark< inverted question mark0.0001), P. vivax-infected individuals demonstrated a significant increase in memory CD8+TNF- inverted question mark+ (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.016) and CD8+IL-10+ (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.004) cells. Positive correlations were observed between absolute numbers of CD8+IL-10+ and numbers of CD8+IFN- inverted question mark+ (p inverted question mark< inverted question mark0.001) and CD8+TNF- inverted question mark+ T cells (p inverted question mark inverted question mark inverted question mark0.0001). Finally, an increase in the plasma levels of TNF- inverted question mark (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.017) and IL-10 (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.006) and a decrease in the IFN- inverted question mark plasma level (p <0.0001) were observed in the P. vivax-infected individuals.Conclusions P. vivax infection reduces the numbers of different subsets of CD8+ T cells, particularly the memory cells, during blood-stage of infection and enhances the number of CD8+ memory T cells expressing IL-10, which positively correlates with the number of cells expressing TNF- inverted question mark and IFN- inverted question mark.',\n",

Phosphorothioate (PS) backbone modification of nucleotide-based drugs is common practice to protect these promising drug candidates from rapid degradation by plasma and intracellular nucleases. Effects of the changes in physicochemical properties associated with PS modification on platelets have not been elucidated so far. Here we report the unexpected binding of PS-modified oligonucleotides to platelets eliciting strong platelet activation, signaling, reactive oxygen species generation, adhesion, spreading, aggregation, and thrombus formation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the platelet-specific receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) mediates these platelet-activating effects. Notably, platelets from GPVI function-deficient patients do not exhibit binding of PS-modified oligonucleotides, and platelet activation is fully abolished. Our data demonstrate a novel, unexpected, PS backbone-dependent, platelet-activating effect of nucleotide-based drug candidates mediated by GPVI.

However, studies that analyzed mitochondrial function at the level of selected enzymatic activities in peripheral tissues have produced conflicting data. We considered the electron transport chain as a complex system with mitochondrial membrane potential as an integrative indicator for mitochondrial fitness. METHODS: Twenty-five IPD patients (nine females; mean disease duration, 6.2 years) and 16 healthy age-matched controls (12 females) were recruited. Live platelets were purified using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and single-cell data on mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi) were measured by cytometry and challenged with a protonophore agent. RESULTS: Functional mitochondrial membrane potential was detected in all participants. The challenge test reduced the membrane potential in all IPD patients and controls (P < 0.001). However, the response to the challenge was not significantly different between patients and controls. INTERPRETATION: While the reported protonophore challenge assay is a valid marker of overall mitochondrial function in live platelets, intact mitochondrial membrane potential in platelets derived from IPD patients suggests that presumed mitochondrial enzymatic deficiencies are compensable in this cell type. In consequence, mitochondrial membrane potential in platelets cannot be used as a diagnostic biomarker for nonstratified IPD but should be further explored in potential Parkinson's disease subtypes and tissues with higher energy demands.\",\n",

STUDY DESIGN: This study was a cross-sectional survey. Students from 8 metropolitan cities in China were studied in November and December, 2005. There were 20,803 elementary-school Chinese children (49.6% boys, mean age, 9.19 years) enrolled. Questions from the standard questionnaire of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children were completed to enable us to examine the pattern of current AR. The potential confounders and pre-and postnatal risk factors were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of AR was found in this study to be 9.8%. After adjusting for several likely confounders, there was a higher likelihood of AR in school-aged children who were not exclusively breastfed in the first 4 months of their lives (odds ratio [OR]: 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.41), children who were born post-term (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.12-1.60), children delivered by cesarean section (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.00-1.19), or children born to mothers who experienced depressive symptoms during the pre- and postnatal periods (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.15-1.42). CONCLUSIONS: AR in school-aged children was found to be associated with pre- and postnatal events. These findings indicate that strategies to reduce exposure to risk factors during pre- and postnatal periods for childhood allergies might be warranted.',\n",

However, the potential mechanisms regarding this rapid benefit of Ator remain elusive. Our study introduced three different ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) models: I/R in vivo, I/R in vitro and oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery (OGD/R) in primary neonatal rat cardiac myocytes to observe the protective effect of a single loading dose of Ator pre-treatment and further to explore the potential mechanisms of this protective effect with confocal laser scanning microscopy, flow cytometry, biochemical and morphology methods. We found that the pre-treatment of high-dose Ator decreased the cardiac injury and maintained the integrity of mitochondria in all three of the I/R models, which was similar to ischaemic pre-conditioning (IPC). We used the mitochondrial KATP channels (mitoKATP channels) inhibitor 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opener lonidamine (LND) to analyse the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that the pre-treatment of Ator significantly decreased I/R-induced injury, and maintained the functional integrity of mitochondria through alleviating Ca2+ overload, reactive oxygen species burst, inhibiting the opening of mPTP and preventing mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) depolarisation. The present results demonstrated that a single dose of Ator might protect the myocardium from I/R-induced injury by inhibiting the mPTP opening through activating the mitoKATP channels. This result may contribute toward the development of novel strategies for clinical cardioprotection against I/R injury.',\n",
       " 'Predictors of Barefoot Plantar Pressure during Walking in Patients with Diabetes, Peripheral Neuropathy and a History of Ulceration.': 'Predictors of Barefoot Plantar Pressure during Walking in Patients with Diabetes, Peripheral Neuropathy and a History of Ulceration.\\nOBJECTIVE: Elevated dynamic plantar foot pressures significantly increase the risk of foot ulceration in diabetes mellitus. The aim was to determine which factors predict plantar pressures in a population of diabetic patients who are at high-risk of foot ulceration. METHODS: Patients with diabetes, peripheral neuropathy and a history of ulceration were eligible for inclusion in this cross sectional study. Demographic data, foot structure and function, and disease-related factors were recorded and used as potential predictor variables in the analyses. Barefoot peak pressures during walking were calculated for the heel, midfoot, forefoot, lesser toes, and hallux regions. Potential predictors were investigated using multivariate linear regression analyses. 167 participants with mean age of 63 years contributed 329 feet to the analyses. RESULTS: The regression models were able to predict between 6% (heel) and 41% (midfoot) of the variation in peak plantar pressures. The largest contributing factor in the heel model was glycosylated haemoglobin concentration, in the midfoot Charcot deformity, in the forefoot prominent metatarsal heads, in the lesser toes hammer toe deformity and in the hallux previous ulceration. Variables with local effects (e.g. foot deformity) were stronger predictors of plantar pressure than global features (e.g. body mass, age, gender, or diabetes duration). CONCLUSION: The presence of local deformity was the largest contributing factor to barefoot dynamic plantar pressure in high-risk diabetic patients and should therefore be adequately managed to reduce plantar pressure and ulcer risk. However, a significant amount of variance is unexplained by the models, which advocates the quantitative measurement of plantar pressures in the clinical risk assessment of the patient.',\n",

Patient education has long been recognized as a component of effective diabetes management, but the impact of counseling and education (C/E) interventions on health care costs is not fully understood. Objectives. To identify the incidence and type of diabetes C/E received by type 2 diabetes patients and to evaluate associated economic and clinical outcomes. Methods. This retrospective cohort study used the Premier-Optum Continuum of Care database (2005-2009) to compare adult patients with type 2 diabetes receiving C/E to those not receiving C/E (control). The index date was the first C/E date or, in the control cohort, a randomly assigned date on which some care was delivered. Patients had at least 6 months' pre-index and 12 months' post-index continuous health plan coverage. Health care costs and glycemic levels were evaluated over 12 and 6 months, respectively, with adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics using propensity score matching (PSM). Results. Of 26,790 patients identified, 9.3% received at least one C/E intervention (mean age 53 years, 47% men) and 90.7% received no C/E (mean age 57 years, 54% men). Standard diabetes education was the most common form of C/E (73%). After PSM, C/E patients had some improvements in glycemic levels (among those with laboratory values available), without increased risk for hypoglycemia, and incurred $2,335 per-patient less in diabetes-related health care costs, although their total health care costs increased. Conclusions. Despite the low uptake of C/E services, C/E interventions may be associated with economic and clinical benefits at 12 months. Further analyses are needed to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of such initiatives.\",\n",

Contamination of toys, books or other items by peanut butter in areas where individuals have eaten may occur in hospital waiting rooms and cafeterias. It is not known if hospital cleaning wipes are effective in removing peanut allergen. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether cleaning peanut contaminated items with common household and hospital cleaning wipes would remove peanut allergen. METHODS: 5 mL of peanut butter was evenly smeared on a 12 inch by 12 inch (30.5 by 30.5 cm) square on a nonporous (laminated plastic) table surface, a plastic doll, and a textured plastic ball, and 2.5 mL was applied to smooth and textured book covers. Samples for measurement of Ara h 1 were collected prior to the application of the peanut butter (baseline), and after cleaning with a common household wipe and two commercial hospital wipes. A monoclonal-based ELISA for arachis hypogaea allergen 1 (Ara h 1), range of detection 1.95-2000 ng/mL, was used to assess peanut allergen on each item. The samples were diluted 1:50 for testing. RESULTS: At baseline, there was no detectable Ara h 1 allergen on any item at baseline. Detectable Ara h 1 was detected on all products after applying peanut butter (range 1.2-19.0 micrograms/mL). After cleaning with any product, no Ara h 1 was detected on any item. CONCLUSIONS: Table surfaces, book covers and plastic toys can be cleaned to remove peanut allergen Ara h 1 using common household and hospital cleaning wipes. Regular cleaning of these products or cleaning prior to their use should be promoted to reduce the risk of accidental peanut exposure, especially in areas where they have been used by many children.',\n",

       " 'Resveratrol Prevents Oxidative Stress-Induced Senescence and Proliferative Dysfunction by Activating the AMPK-FOXO3 Cascade in Cultured Primary Human Keratinocytes.': \"Resveratrol Prevents Oxidative Stress-Induced Senescence and Proliferative Dysfunction by Activating the AMPK-FOXO3 Cascade in Cultured Primary Human Keratinocytes.\\nThe aging process is perceived as resulting from a combination of intrinsic factors such as changes in intracellular signaling and extrinsic factors, most notably environmental stressors. In skin, the relationship between intrinsic changes and keratinocyte function is not clearly understood. Previously, we found that increasing the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppressed senescence in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-treated human primary keratinocytes, a model of oxidative stress-induced cellular aging. Using this model in the present study, we observed that resveratrol, an agent that increases the activities of both AMPK and sirtuins, ameliorated two age-associated phenotypes: cellular senescence and proliferative dysfunction. In addition, we found that treatment of keratinocytes with Ex527, a specific inhibitor of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), attenuated the ability of resveratrol to suppress senescence. In keeping with the latter observation, we noted that compared to non-senescent keratinocytes, senescent cells lacked SIRT1. In addition to these effects on H2O2-induced senescence, resveratrol also prevented the H2O2-induced decrease in proliferation (as indicated by 3H-thymidine incorporation) in the presence of insulin. This effect was abrogated by inhibition of AMPK but not SIRT1. Compared to endothelium, we found that human keratinocytes expressed relatively high levels of Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), a downstream target of both AMPK and SIRT1. Treatment of keratinocytes with resveratrol transactivated FOXO3 and increased the expression of its target genes including catalase. Resveratrol's effects on both senescence and proliferation disappeared when FOXO3 was knocked down. Finally, we performed an exploratory study which showed that skin from humans over 50 years old had lower AMPK activity than skin from individuals under age 20. Collectively, these findings suggest that the effects of resveratrol on keratinocyte senescence and proliferation are regulated by the AMPK-FOXO3 pathway and in some situations, but not all, by SIRT1.\",\n",

Prematurity is a risk factor for severe RV infection in early life, but is unknown if RV elicits enhanced pro-asthmatic airway cytokine responses in premature infants. This study investigated if young children born severely premature (<32 weeks gestation) exhibit airway secretion of Th2 and Th17 cytokines during natural RV infections and if RV-induced Th2-Th17 responses are linked to more respiratory morbidity in premature children during the first two years of life. METHODS: We measured Th2 and Th17 nasal airway cytokines in a retrospective cohort of young children aged 0-2 years with PCR-confirmed RV infection or non-detectable virus. Protein levels of IL-4, IL- 13, TSLP and IL-17 were determined with multiplex immunoassays. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained by electronic medical record (EMR) review. RESULTS: The study comprised 214 children born full term (n=108), pre-term (n=44) or severely premature (n=62). Natural RV infection in severely premature children was associated with elevated airway secretion of Th2 (IL-4 and IL-13) and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines, particularly in subjects with history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Severely premature children with high RV-induced airway IL-4 had recurrent respiratory hospitalizations (median 3.65 hosp/year; IQR 2.8-4.8) and were more likely to have at least one pediatric intensive care unit admission during the first two years of life (OR 8.72; 95% CI 1.3-58.7; p=0.02).

However, the role of serum RDW levels in drug-eluting stent (DES) restenosis remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum RDW levels and in-stent restenosis (ISR) after coronary stenting with DES in stable angina pectoris (SAP) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 293 consecutive chronic SAP patients with coronary DES implantation were enrolled in this study. The ISR was analyzed by coronary angiography analysis at a mean follow-up of 8 months. According to whether ISR was detected, patients were divided into two groups: the ISR group (n=45) and the non-ISR group (n=247). Serum RDW was assessed both at admission and at the 8-month follow-up in all patients. Standard medication was continued throughout the investigation period. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Patients in the ISR group had significantly higher RDW levels compared with patients in the non-ISR group both at admission and at follow-up (P<0.01, respectively). Furthermore, the ISR group had significantly longer stent length and lower stent diameter compared with the non-ISR group (P<0.01, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus, current smoking, RDW levels, C-reactive protein levels, stent length, and stent diameter were associated independently with ISR. CONCLUSION: Serum RDW level may independently predict ISR at both admission and follow-up in SAP patients with coronary DES implantation, which indicates that a chronic inflammatory response might be involved in the pathogenesis of ISR.',\n",

Answers were transmitted through short message services (SMS).ResultsThe EQA comprised 2344 HW and 1028 HF covering 10/11 provinces in DRC. Overall, median HW score (sum of correct answers on 10 MCQ photographs for each HW) was 9.0 (interquartile range 7.5 inverted question mark 10); MCQ scores (the % of correct answers for a particular photograph) ranged from 54.8% to 91.6%. Most common errors were (i) reading or interpreting faint or weak line intensities as negative (3.3%, 7.2%, 24.3% and 29.1% for 4 MCQ photographs), (ii) failure to distinguish the correct Plasmodium species (3.4% to 7.0%), (iii) missing invalid test results (8.4% and 23.6%) and (iv) missing negative test results (10.0% and 12.4%). HW who were trained less than 12 months ago had best MCQ scores for 7/10 photographs as well as a significantly higher proportion of 10/10 scores, but absolute differences in MCQ scores were small. HW who had participated in a previous EQA performed significantly better for 4/10 photographs compared to those who had not. Except for two photographs, MCQ scores were comparable for all levels of the HF hierarchy and non-laboratory staff (HW from health posts) had similar performance as to laboratory staff. Main findings of the questionnaire were (i) use of other RDT products than recommended by the national malaria control programme (nearly 20% of participating HF), (ii) lack of training for a third (33.6%) of HF, (iii) high proportions (two-thirds, 66.5%) of HF reporting stock-outs.ConclusionsThe present EQA revealed common errors in RDT reading and interpretation by HW in DRC. Performances of non-laboratory and laboratory staff were similar and dedicated training was shown to improve HW competence although to a moderate extent.

To date, there is little information on their safety and clinical effects for children and adolescents with allergic disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective survey of patient notes of 2927 children and adolescents across 136 centres who had received AIT with depigmented-polymerised extracts to pollen or mite allergens for at least one year to collect documentation on safety and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: 38% of patients had local reactions, of these 145 were larger than 12 cm in diameter. Systemic reactions were documented in 2.7% of children and 1.2% of adolescents. There were no documented cases of anaphylactic shock. There were significant reductions in the frequency of patients with recorded nasal symptoms over time of treatment. Moreover, the prescribing-rate of rescue medication was reduced over the course of SCIT.

There is growing evidence that RFA-mediated necrosis can modulate host immune responses. Here we analyzed serum inflammatory factors as well as immunosuppressive cells in the peripheral blood to discover possible prognostic indicators. Patients and Methods: Peripheral blood and serum samples were collected before RFA and within 3 months after the treatment in a total of 12 patients. Inflammatory cytokines and growth factors were measured in serum by the Bio-Plex assay. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) were evaluated in the peripheral blood via flow cytometry. Results: In patients developing local or lymphogenic tumor relapse (n=4), we found an early significant increase in the concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as well as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)-2 and CCL-4 as compared to patients without relapse (n=4) and healthy donors (n=5). These changes were associated with an elevated activity of circulating MDSC indicated by an increased nitric oxide (NO) production in these cells. Discussion: Elevated serum levels of TNF-alpha, CCL-2 and CCL-4 associated with an increased NO production in circulating MDSCs might be an early indicator of the incomplete RFA and subsequently a potential tumor relapse in NSCLC.

METHODS: The study was based on data obtained in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2010 to 2011. Education level and household income were used as indicators for SES. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate SES and other demographic variables as related factors for influenza vaccination, the primary outcome. RESULTS: Higher household income was positively associated with higher vaccine uptake in the younger (19-49 years) group [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-2.23], whereas the low-income and low-education group had increased vaccination coverage than the middle-income and middle-education group in the older (>/= 50 years) group (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.69). Current smokers tend to be unvaccinated in all age groups. Among individuals aged >/= 50, older age, mild to moderate alcohol consumption, regular exercise, and having co-morbidities were positively associated with vaccination, while those who self-reported their health status as good were less likely to be vaccinated.

Previously, mice semi-immune to malaria was developed. Three cycles of infection and cure (`three-cure inverted question mark) were required to protect mice against Plasmodium berghei (ANKA strain) infection.MethodsC57BL/6 J mice underwent three cycles of P. berghei infection and drug-cure to become semi-immune. The spleens of infected semi-immune mice were collected for flow cytometry analysis. CD11c(+) cells of semi-immune mice were isolated and transferred into naive mice which were subsequently challenged and followed up by survival and parasitaemia.ResultsThe percentages of splenic CD4(+) and CD11c(+) cells were increased in semi-immune mice on day 7 post-infection. The proportion and number of B220(+)CD11c(+)low cells (plasmacytoid dendritic cells, DCs) was higher in semi-immune, three-cure mice than in their naive littermates on day 7 post-infection (2.6 vs 1.1% and 491,031 vs 149,699, respectively). In adoptive transfer experiment, three months after the third cured P. berghei infection, splenic CD11c(+) DCs of non-infected, semi-immune, three-cure mice slowed Plasmodium proliferation and decreased the death rate due to neurological pathology in recipient mice. In addition, anti-P. berghei IgG1 level was higher in mice transferred with CD11c(+) cells of semi-immune, three-cure mice than mice transferred with CD11c(+) cells of naive counterparts.ConclusionCD11c(+) cells of semi-immune mice protect against experimental cerebral malaria three months after the third cured malaria, potentially through protective plasmacytoid DCs and enhanced production of malaria-specific antibody.',\n",

We report a case of 25-year-old female patient, who presented with status migrainosus fulfilling the criteria of international classification of headache disorder. She was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) after an extensive work-up and long-term clinical and radiological follow-up. FINDINGS: At the onset of status migrainosus, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the presence of several demyelinating lesions fulfilling Swanton criteria. She was started on migraine prophylactic treatment but there was no subsequent response. One year later, she presented with recurrent status migrainosus and a follow-up MRI revealed multiple gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the brain. She was treated with abortive migraine medications. Within the following 2 year, she developed ascending parasthesia and weakness of both lower limbs indicative of incomplete transverse myelitis in association with recurrent status migrainosus. A diagnosis of MS was established based on a follow-up MRI that satisfied the revised 2010 McDonald criteria. Both the headache and neurological signs improved with IV methylprednisolone therapy. Her headache entered remission after initiation of a disease modifying therapy. CONCLUSION: Status migrainosus can be the initial presentation of MS.

In this scenario, much knowledge has been generated from the study of motor neurons derived from embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. These methods, however, have advantages and disadvantages, which must be balanced on experimental design. Preclinical studies provide valuable information, making it possible to combine diverse methods to build an expanded knowledge of ALS pathophysiology. In addition to using stem cells as experimental models for understanding disease mechanism, these cells had been quoted for therapy in ALS. Despite ethical issues involved in its use, cell therapy with neural stem cells stands out. A phase I clinical trial was recently completed and a phase II is on its way, attesting the method's safety. In another approach, mesenchymal stromal cells capable of releasing neuroregulatory and anti-inflammatory factors have also been listed as candidates for cell therapy for ALS, and have been admitted as safe in a phase I trial. Despite recent advances, application of stem cells as an actual therapy for ALS patients is still in debate. Here, we discuss how stem cells have been useful in modeling ALS and address critical topics concerning their therapeutic use, such as administration protocols, injection site, cell type to be administered, type of transplantation (autologous vs. allogeneic) among other issues with particular implications for ALS therapy.

       " 'Suppressive effect of insulin on the gene expression and plasma concentrations of mediators of asthmatic inflammation.': 'Suppressive effect of insulin on the gene expression and plasma concentrations of mediators of asthmatic inflammation.\\nBackground and Hypothesis. Following our recent demonstration that the chronic inflammatory and insulin resistant state of obesity is associated with an increase in the expression of mediators known to contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and that weight loss after gastric bypass surgery results in the reduction of these genes, we have now hypothesized that insulin suppresses the cellular expression and plasma concentrations of these mediators. Methods. The expression of IL-4, LIGHT, LTBR, ADAM-33, and TSLP in MNC and plasma concentrations of LIGHT, TGF-beta1, MMP-9, MCP-1, TSLP, and NOM in obese patients with T2DM were measured before, during, and after the infusion of a low dose (2 U/h) infusion of insulin for 4 hours. The patients were also infused with dextrose or saline for 4 hours on two separate visits and served as controls. Results. Following insulin infusion, the mRNA expression of IL-4, ADAM-33, LIGHT, and LTBR mRNA expression fell significantly (P < 0.05 for all). There was also a concomitant reduction in plasma NOM, LIGHT, TGF-beta1, MCP-1, and MMP-9 concentrations. Conclusions. Insulin suppresses the expression of these genes and mediators related to asthma and may, therefore, have a potential role in the treatment of asthma.',\n",

       " 'The Avian Transcriptome Response to Malaria Infection.': 'The Avian Transcriptome Response to Malaria Infection.\\nMalaria parasites are highly virulent pathogens which infect a wide range of vertebrates. Despite their importance, the way different hosts control and suppress malaria infections remains poorly understood. With recent developments in next generation sequencing techniques, however, it is now possible to quantify the response of the entire transcriptome to infections. We experimentally infected Eurasian siskins (Spinus spinus) with avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium ashfordi), and used high-throughput RNA-sequencing to measure the avian transcriptome in blood collected before infection (day 0), during peak parasitemia (day 21 post infection), and when parasitemia was decreasing (day 31). We found considerable differences in the transcriptomes of infected and uninfected individuals, with a large number of genes differentially expressed during both peak and decreasing parasitemia stages. These genes were overrepresented among functions involved in the immune system, stress response, cell death regulation, metabolism, and telomerase activity. Comparative analyses of the differentially expressed genes in our study to those found in other hosts of malaria (human and mouse), revealed a set of genes that are potentially involved in highly conserved evolutionary responses to malaria infection. By using RNA-sequencing we gained a more complete view of the host response, and were able to pinpoint not only well documented host genes, but also unannotated genes with clear significance during infection, such as microRNAs. This study shows how the avian blood transcriptome shifts in response to malaria infection, and we believe it will facilitate further research into the diversity of molecular mechanisms that hosts utilize to fight malaria infections.',\n",

In this study, we examined the effects of triazoloacridinone C-1305, an antitumor compound, on AML cells with different FLT3 status in vitro.Methods:A panel of human leukemic cell lines with different FLT3 status was used, including FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations (FLT3-ITD, MV-4-11), wild-type FLT3 (RS-4-11) and null-FLT3 (U937) cells. Cell proliferation was estimated using MTT assays, and apoptosis was studied with flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. FLT3 kinase activity (phosphorylation of FLT3 at Tyr591) was determined with ELISA and Western blotting. FLT3 downstream signaling proteins involving AKT, MAPK and STAT5 were examined by Western blotting. RNA silencing was used to decrease the endogenous FLT3.Results:The mutant FLT3-ITD cells were more sensitive to C-1305 than the wild-type FLT3 and null-FLT3 cells (the IC50 values measured at 24 h were 1.2+/-0.17, 2.0+/-09, 7.6+/-1.6 mumol/L, respectively). C-1305 (1-10 mumol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the kinase activity of FLT3, which was more pronounced in the mutant FLT3-ITD cells than in the wild-type FLT3 cells. Furthermore, C-1305 dose-dependently decreased the phosphorylation of STAT5 and MAPK and the inhibitory phosphorylation of Bad, and induced time- and dose-dependent apoptosis in the 3 cell lines with the null-FLT3 cells being the least susceptible to C-1305-induced apoptosis. Knockdown of FLT3 with siRNA significantly decreased C-1305-induced cytotoxicity in the mutant FLT3-ITD cells.Conclusion:C-1305 induces apoptosis in FLT3-ITD-expressing human leukemia cells in vitro, suggesting that mutated FLT3 kinase can be a new target for C-1305, and C-1305 may be a drug candidate for the therapeutic intervention in FLT3-associated AML.',\n",

The mammalian RBC is normally unable to endocytose or phagocytose and the events leading to invasion are incompletely understood. Initially both parasites are surrounded by the RBC plasma membrane-derived parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) that is formed during invasion. In P. falciparum infected RBC the PVM persists at least until parasite replication is completed whereas it has been proposed that the B. divergens PVM is disintegrated soon upon invasion. Here we have used a B. divergens strain adapted to human RBC to investigate the formation and fate of the PVM. Using ultrastructural analysis and whole mount or on-section immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling we demonstrate that the initial vacuolar membrane is formed from protein and lipid components of the RBC plasma membrane. Integral membrane proteins band 3 and glycophorin A, and the cytoskeletal protein spectrin are associated with the PVM of B. divergens, but are absent from the PVM of P. falciparum at the ring or the trophozoite stage. Our results provide evidence that the biophysical properties of the RBC cytoskeleton per se do not preclude the internalization of cytoskeletal proteins by invading parasites.',\n",

Advances in multiparametric flow-cytometry have revealed that the functional quality of pathogen-specific CD4 T cells, determines immune protection in many infectious models. Little is known about the functional characteristics of Plasmodium-specific CD4 responses in immune and non-immune individuals. METHODS: We compared T cell responses to P. falciparum among household-matched children and adults residing in high and low malaria transmission settings in Uganda. PBMCs were stimulated with P. falciparum antigen and IFNgamma, IL2, IL10 and TNFalpha production was analyzed via multiparametric flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that the magnitude of CD4 responses was greater in areas of high transmission, but was similar between children and adults at each site. In high transmission settings, most P. falciparum-specific CD4 T cells in children produced IL10, while responses in adults were dominated by IFNgamma and TNFalpha. In contrast, in low transmission settings, responses in both children and adults were dominated by IFNgamma and TNFalpha. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight major differences in the CD4 response of immune adults and non-immune children that may be relevant for immune protection from malaria.',\n",

Although it is well known that the RAS affects normal LUT function, very little is known about RAS effects on the diabetic LUT. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of chronic angiotensin II (AngII) treatment on the LUT in a model of type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Ins2(Akita) diabetic mice (20 weeks old) and their age-matched background controls underwent conscious cystometric evaluation after 4 weeks of chronic AngII treatment (700 ng/kg/min by osmotic pump) or vehicle (saline). RESULTS: Diabetic mice had compensated LUT function with bladder hypertrophy. Specifically, micturition volume, residual volume, and bladder capacity were all increased, while voiding efficiency and pressure generation were unchanged as bladder mass, contraction duration, and phasic urethral function were increased. AngII significantly increased voiding efficiency and peak voiding pressure and decreased phasic frequency irrespective of diabetic state and, in diabetic but not normoglycemic control mice, significantly decreased residual volume and increased contraction duration and nonphasic contraction duration. CONCLUSIONS: The Ins2(Akita) diabetic mice had compensated LUT function at 20 weeks of age. Even under these conditions, AngII had beneficial effects on LUT function, resulting in increased voiding efficiency. Future studies should therefore be conducted to determine whether AngII can rescue the decompensated LUT function occurring in end-stage diabetic uropathy.',\n",
       " 'The evolution of genomic GC content undergoes a rapid reversal within the genus Plasmodium.': 'The evolution of genomic GC content undergoes a rapid reversal within the genus Plasmodium.\\nThe genome of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum is extremely AT rich. This bias toward a low GC content is a characteristic of several, but not all, species within the genus Plasmodium. We compared 4283 orthologous pairs of protein-coding sequences between Plasmodium falciparum and the less AT-biased Plasmodium vivax. Our results indicate that the common ancestor of these two species was also extremely AT rich. This means that, although there was a strong bias toward A+T during the early evolution of the ancestral Plasmodium lineage, there was a subsequent reversal of this trend during the more recent evolution of some species, such as P. vivax. Moreover, we show that not only is the P. vivax genome losing its AT richness, it is actually gaining a very significant degree of GC richness. This example illustrates the potential volatility of nucleotide content during the course of molecular evolution. Such reversible fluxes in nucleotide content within lineages could have important implications for phylogenetic reconstruction based on molecular sequence data.',\n",

Thirty-five healthy men (unexposed group) and 64 male pesticide sprayers (exposed group) were recruited for clinical evaluation of fertility status. Fresh semen samples were evaluated for sperm quality and analyzed for DNA fragmentation index (DFI) by flow cytometry. Pesticide exposure was assessed by measuring erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase and plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) with a Test-mate ChE field kit. Serum levels of total testosterone (Tt), prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and free thyroxine (FT4) were analyzed using enzyme immunoassay kits. Evidence of pesticide exposure was found in 88.5% of sprayers and significant increments were observed in sperm DFI with significant decrease in some semen parameters. DFI was negatively correlated with BuChE, sperm concentration, morphology, and vitality in these pesticide sprayers. The levels of Tt, PRL, FT4, and TSH appeared to be normal; however, there was a tendency for increased LH and FSH levels in exposed workers. The results confirm the potential impact of chronic occupational exposure to OP and CB pesticides on male reproductive function, which may cause damage to sperm chromatin, decrease semen quality, and produce alterations in reproductive hormones, leading to adverse reproductive health outcomes.',\n",

Thus, this study aimed to verify the action of caffeic acid on human monocytes in an attempt to verify its effects on the innate immunity, and to analyse its participation in propolis activity. METHODS: Monocytes viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method after incubation with caffeic acid. Cell markers expression by monocytes (Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2, TLR-4, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR and CD80) was analysed by flow cytometry. TNF-alpha and IL-10 production was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the activity of monocytes against Candida albicans was investigated after incubation with different concentrations of caffeic acid. KEY FINDINGS: Caffeic acid downregulated TLR-2 and HLA-DR expression and inhibited cytokine production whereas it upregulated the fungicidal activity of monocytes, without affecting cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeic acid exerted an immunomodulatory action in human monocytes in the evaluated parameters depending on concentration, with no cytotoxic effects. Moreover, it was partially involved in propolis action.',\n",

But, there is no clear evidence regarding the effect of atopic status and the type of sensitized allergen on emotional status. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of house dust mites and pollen allergies on emotional status, asthma control and the quality of life in patients with atopic asthma. METHODS: The study included 174 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with asthma accoring to the GINA criteria and who did not receive therapy for their allergy. All patients underwent a skin prick test. The asthma control, quality of life, and emotional status were evaluated using the ACT (asthma control test), AQLQ (asthma-specific quality of life questionnaire), and HAD (hospital anxiety depression questionnaire). RESULTS: Atopy was detected in 134 (78.7%) patients. Of those patients: 58 (33.3%) had anxiety and 83 (47.7%) had depression. There was no relationship between emotional status, atopic status, and the type of indoor/outdoor allergen. Furthermore, there was no relationship between atopy and asthma severity, asthma control, and the quality of life. The anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher and the quality of life scores lower in the uncontrolled asthma group. The ACT and AQLQ scores were also lower in the anxiety and depression groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that anxiety and depression are prevalent in patients with uncontrolled asthma, and atopic status did not affect the scores in ACT, AQLQ, and emotional status tests.',\n",
       " 'Time-to-infection by Plasmodium falciparum is largely determined by random factors.': 'Time-to-infection by Plasmodium falciparum is largely determined by random factors.\\nBACKGROUND: The identification of protective immune responses to P. falciparum infection is an important goal for the development of a vaccine for malaria. This requires the identification of susceptible and resistant individuals, so that their immune responses may be studied. Time-to-infection studies are one method for identifying putative susceptible individuals (infected early) versus resistant individuals (infected late). However, the timing of infection is dependent on random factors, such as whether the subject was bitten by an infected mosquito, as well as individual factors, such as their level of immunity. It is important to understand how much of the observed variation in infection is simply due to chance. METHODS: We analyse previously published data from a treatment-time-to-infection study of 201 individuals aged 0.5 to 78 years living in Western Kenya. We use a mathematical modelling approach to investigate the role of immunity versus random factors in determining time-to-infection in this cohort. We extend this analysis using a modelling approach to understand what factors might increase or decrease the utility of these studies for identifying susceptible and resistant individuals. RESULTS: We find that, under most circumstances, the observed distribution of time-to-infection is consistent with this simply being a random process. We find that age, method for detection of infection (PCR versus microscopy), and underlying force of infection are all factors in determining whether time-to-infection is a useful correlate of immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Many epidemiological studies of P. falciparum infection assume that the observed variation in infection outcomes, such as time-to-infection or presence or absence of infection, is determined by host resistance or susceptibility. However, under most circumstances, this distribution appears largely due to the random timing of infection, particularly in children. More direct measurements, such as parasite growth rate, may be more useful than time-to-infection in segregating patients based on their level of immunity.',\n",

It has been previously shown that the tubes are conductive with a resistance of approximately 3MOmega, and have been used in basic DC circuits. Hybrid slime mould-electronic circuits have been proposed, using the protoplasmic tubes, grown between agar, as Physarum wires. This paper aims to evaluate the electrical properties of the protoplasmic tubes with respect to analogue and digital waveforms. The Physarum wires act as low pass filters with a mean cut off frequency of 19kHz (SD 9KHz); they have a 12.1dB/decade roll-off (SD 1.9dB/decade). Mean attenuation across the band-pass range is -6dB (S.D. 4.5dB). The mechanism for the frequency dependant attenuation is unknown however a combination of protoplasmic electrolyte and the cytoskeletal structure is the most likely cause. The tubes last approximately 2 weeks before forming a dry sclerotia, when they cease being conductive and is the prevalent limiting factor of their practical use; this is caused by dehydration and lack of nutrition, a limitation which may be overcome. The potential for Physarum wires in hybrid circuits is strengthened; while previous circuits were simple DC circuits, this work demonstrates that they may be used as electronic components or wires in both digital and analogue circuits or even as a computing component in analogue computers.',\n",

There has been little analysis examining the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on patients undergoing TSS. In this study, we characterize DM's association with postoperative TSS complications. In addition to analysis of associated charges and patient demographics, we performed comparison of complication rates between DM and non-DM patients who have undergone TSS in recent years. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a database encompassing nearly 8 million inpatient hospitalizations, was evaluated for patients undergoing TSS from 2002 to 2010. RESULTS: Of 12,938 TSS patients, 2,173 (16.8%) had a DM diagnosis. The non-DM cohort was younger (50.1 y +/- 16.6SD vs. 56.8 y +/- 14.1; P < 0.001) and had shorter hospitalizations and lesser charges. DM patients had a greater incidence of pulmonary, cardiac, urinary/renal, and fluid/electrolyte complications, and had a lesser incidence of diabetes insipidus (P < 0.05). Upon controlling for age, the greater incidence of pulmonary and fluid/electrolyte complications was present only among patients < 60 years of age. Higher occurrence of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea was noted among black diabetics when compared to non-DM blacks. CONCLUSIONS: DM is associated with greater length of stay and hospital charges among TSS patients. DM patients undergoing TSS have a significantly greater incidence of pulmonary and fluid/electrolyte complications among patients under the age of 60, and greater risk for urinary/renal complications across all ages. Despite a theoretical concern due to an impaired wound-healing in DM patients, association with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea was only noted among black diabetics. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2C.

Prophylactic treatment with sphingosine analogs interferes with experimental asthma by impeding the migration of dendritic cells to draining lymph nodes. However, whether these drugs can also alleviate allergic airway inflammation after its onset remains to be determined. Herein, we investigated to which extent and by which mechanisms the sphingosine analog AAL-R interferes with key features of asthma in a murine model during ongoing allergic inflammation induced by Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.MethodsBALB/c mice were exposed to either D. pteronyssinus or saline, intranasally, once-daily for 10 consecutive days. Mice were treated intratracheally with either AAL-R, its pre-phosphorylated form AFD-R, or the vehicle before every allergen challenge over the last four days, i.e. after the onset of allergic airway inflammation. On day 11, airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured; inflammatory cells and cytokines were quantified in the airways; and the numbers and/or viability of T cells, B cells and dendritic cells were assessed in the lungs and draining lymph nodes.ResultsAAL-R decreased airway hyperresponsiveness induced by D. pteronyssinus by nearly 70%. This was associated with a strong reduction of IL-5 and IL-13 levels in the airways and with a decreased eosinophilic response. Notably, the lung CD4+ T cells were almost entirely eliminated by AAL-R, which concurred with enhanced apoptosis/necrosis in that cell population. This inhibition occurred in the absence of dendritic cell number modulation in draining lymph nodes. On the other hand, the pre-phosphorylated form AFD-R, which preferentially acts on cell-surface sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors, was relatively impotent at enhancing cell death, which led to a less efficient control of T cell and eosinophil responses in the lungs.ConclusionAirway delivery of the non-phosphorylated sphingosine analog, but not its pre-phosphorylated counterpart, is highly efficient at controlling the local T cell response after the onset of allergic airway inflammation. The mechanism appears to involve local induction of lymphocyte apoptosis/necrosis, while mildly affecting dendritic cell and T cell accumulation in draining lymph nodes.',\n",

This study investigated effects of local IL-33 expression in resected HCC on patient survival and on immunological and molecular tumor microenvironment. Methods: Tissue of resected HCCs was stained for H&E, masson trichrome, alpha smooth muscle actin, IL-33, CD8 and IL-13 and analysed by flow cytometry. Besides histomorphologic evaluation, the immunohistochemical stainings were analysed for the respective cell numbers separately for tumor area, infiltrative margin and distant liver stroma. These findings were correlated with clinical data and patient outcome. Further, gene expression of different HCC risk groups was compared using microarrays. Results: In multivariable analysis, infiltration of HCCs by IL-33+ cells (P=0.032) and CD8+ cells (P=0.014) both independently were associated with prolonged patient survival. Flow cytometry demonstrated that cytotoxically active subpopulations of CD8+ cells, in particular CD8+ CD62L- KLRG1+ CD107a+ effectory-memory cells, are the main producers of IL-33 in these HCC patients. Using infiltration by IL-33+ and CD8+ cells as two separate factors, a HCC immune score (HCCIS) was designed and evaluated that stratified patient survival (P=0.0004). This HCCIS identified high and low risk patients who differ in gene expression profiles (P<0.001). Conclusion: Infiltration of HCCs by IL-33+ and CD8+ cells is independently associated with prolonged patient survival. We suggest that this is due to an induction of highly effective cytotoxically active CD8+ CD62L- KLRG1+ CD107a+ effector-memory cells producing IL-33. Based on these two independent factors we established a HCC immune score that provides risk stratification for HCC patients and can be used in the clinical setting.

Malignant melanoma cells exhibit increased levels of autophagy, a process of intracellular digestion that allows cells to survive various stresses including chemotherapies, resulting in reduced patient survival. Autophagy can be inhibited by chemicals like chloroquine (CQ), which prevents fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes, resulting in autophagosome accumulation in most systems. Here, we describe how tested CQ to see whether it could sensitize B16F10 metastatic mouse melanoma cells to the anticancer activities of the natural compounds ursolic acid (UA) and resveratrol (RES). CQ with UA or RES strongly and synergistically reduced the viability of B16F10 mouse melanoma and A375 human melanoma cells. Surprisingly, flow cytometry of acridine orange-stained cells showed that UA or RES in combination with CQ significantly reduced autophagosome levels. Western blotting analysis revealed that CQ plus UA or RES paradoxically increased LC3II, indicative of autophagosome accumulation. In addition, CQ plus RES synergistically decreased the levels of both autophagy initiator beclin-1 and autophagy supporter p62. These results indicate that CQ with UA or RES strongly and synergistically reduces the viability of B16F10 and A375 melanoma cells. However, studies on B16F10 cells have shown that the synergistic effect was not mediated by inhibition of autophagy induced by UA or RES. These compounds are well-tolerated in humans, and CQ has shown promise as an adjuvant therapy. These combinations may be valuable treatment strategies for melanoma.',\n",

We analyzed national survey data from children aged 6-59 months in four sub-Saharan African countries over an 18-month time period, to determine the risk of Plasmodium spp. parasitemia (n=8390) and Plasmodium falciparum HRP-2 (PfHRP-2)-related antigenemia (n=6121) following vitamin A supplementation and standard vaccination.

Patients diagnosed with eosinophilic CRSwNP but without malignancies or asthma and undergoing elective endoscopic sinus surgery were recruited. Three primary fibroblast cultures were established using the polyp specimens obtained from these patients. The third to eighth passages of the fibroblasts were used for in vitro studies. Nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts were stimulated with IL-1beta (10 ng/mL) for 24 hours, followed by replacement with media alone or with calcitriol or tacalcitol (10muM) and incubation for another 24 hours. After the treatments, the levels of secreted eotaxin and RANTES were evaluated by ELISA assays. The results showed that IL-1beta could substantially stimulate the secretion of eotaxin (p < 0.01) and RANTES (p < 0.01) in nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts. More importantly, this stimulatory effect was significantly suppressed by adding calcitriol (p </= 0.002 for eotaxin and p </= 0.008 for RANTES) or tacalcitol (p </= 0.009 for eotaxin and p </= 0.02 for RANTES). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of vitamin D derivatives on eotaxin and RANTES secretion might shed light not only on the disease mechanism, but also on the potential use of vitamin D in pharmacotherapy of Taiwanese patients with CRSwNP.',\n",
       " 'Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women impairs Regulatory T cell function.': 'Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women impairs Regulatory T cell function.\\nRegulatory T cells and IgE receptors (CD23 & CD21) on B cells were assessed in vitamin D deficient pregnant women. For this, 153 pregnant women were recruited from a government hospital and were categorized into three groups based on 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) status. Regulatory T cell population (Treg cells) and CD23/CD21 expression on B cells were quantified by FACS ARIA II in maternal blood at third trimester; and the same parameters were evaluated in cord blood soon after delivery. In addition, TGF beta and IL-10 were quantified in maternal and cord blood by using Milliplex kits. In a representative sample of eight women from each group (vitamin D sufficient, insufficient and deficient), placental tissues were processed for mRNA expressions of vitamin D receptor (VDR), retinoic acid receptor (RXR), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and vitamin D regulating enzymes. Of the 153 pregnant women, 18 were sufficient (>/= 30 ng/mL), 55 were insufficient (20-29 ng/mL) and 80 were deficient (</= 19 ng/mL) for 25(OH)D3 status. The maternal blood Treg cell population (mean (%) +/- SE) was lower (p < 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient (0.2 +/- 0.01) pregnant women compared to insufficient (0.34 +/- 0.01) and sufficient (0.45 +/- 0.02) pregnant women. Similarly, cord blood Treg cell population (mean (%) +/- SE) was also lower (p < 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient (0.63 +/- 0.03) pregnant women when compared to insufficient (1.05 +/- 0.04) and sufficient (1.75 +/- 0.02) pregnant women. Mean (%) +/- SE of B cells with CD23 and CD21 in maternal blood was higher (p < 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient pregnant women (0.35 +/- 0.02; 1.65 +/- 0.04) when compared to insufficient (0.22 +/- 0.02; 0.55 +/- 0.05) and sufficient (0.15 +/- 0.02; 0.21 +/- 0.01) pregnant women. Similarly, mean (%) +/- SE of B cell population with CD23 and CD21 in cord blood was also higher (p < 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient (0.41 +/- 0.02; 1.2 +/- 0.03) when compared to insufficient (0.32 +/- 0.01; 0.6 +/- 0.05) and sufficient (0.2 +/- 0.01; 0.4 +/- 0.02) pregnant women. Regulatory cytokines, TGF beta and IL-10 were lower (p < 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 insufficient and deficient subjects. In the placenta tissue of women with 25(OH)D3 deficiency, the regulatory T cell transcription factor FOXP3, vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoic acid receptor (RXR) expressions were downregulated. In contrast, CD23, CD21 and VDBP expressions were upregulated in 25(OH)D3 deficient and insufficient women. Vitamin D regulating enzymes (CYP24A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1) expression were also altered in women with 25(OH)D3 deficiency. The current study shows that impaired maternal 25(OH)D3 during pregnancy influences the spectrum of immune cells such as regulatory T cells and B cells with IgE receptors and this in turn may be linked to allergy and asthma in neonates.',\n",
       " 'Vitamin D supplementation in children with asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.': 'Vitamin D supplementation in children with asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\\nBackgroundEpidemiologic studies suggest an association between vitamin D deficiency and atopic diseases, including asthma. The objective of this study was to systematically review the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation in children with asthma.MethodsWe used standard Cochrane systematic review methodology. The search strategy included an electronic search in February 2013 of MEDLINE and EMBASE. Two reviewers completed in duplicate and independently study selection, data abstraction, and assessment of risk of bias. We pooled the results of trials using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence by outcome using the GRADE methodology.ResultsFour trials with a total of 149 children met eligibility criteria. The trials had major methodological limitations. Given the four studies reporting on asthma symptoms used different instruments to measure that outcome, we opted not to conduct a meta-analysis. Three of those studies reported improvement in asthma symptoms in the vitamin D supplemented group study, while the fourth reported no effect (very low quality evidence). For the lung function outcome, a meta-analysis of two trials assessing post treatment FEV-1 found a mean difference of 0.54 liters per second (95% CI -5.28; 4.19; low quality evidence). For the vitamin D level outcome, a meta-analysis of three trials found a mean difference of 6.56 ng/ml (95% CI -0.64; 13.77; very low quality evidence).ConclusionsThe available very low to low quality evidence does not confirm or rule out beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation in children with asthma. Large-scale, well-designed and executed randomized controlled trials are needed to better understand the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D in children with asthma.',\n",
       " 'What goes up must come down: biomarkers and novel biologicals in severe asthma.': 'What goes up must come down: biomarkers and novel biologicals in severe asthma.\\nAsthma is a heterogeneous airway disease characterised by typical symptoms in combination with variable airway obstruction. Most patients with asthma have well controlled symptoms and a low risk of asthma attacks with inhaled corticosteroid treatment. However, a clinically important subgroup (~10%) remains symptomatic and/or at risk of asthma attacks despite maximum inhaled therapy. Patients with severe asthma are responsible for a significant proportion of healthcare costs attributable to asthma and have a large unmet need for better treatments. An important advance in recent years has been the recognition that severe asthma is heterogeneous with respect to clinical problems and the pattern of lower airway inflammation. Identification of eosinophilic inflammation in the airways has become an important priority as novel biologicals that target Th2 cytokines, such as anti-IL5, anti- IL-13 and combined anti-IL-4/13 are showing considerable promise as treatments for this sub-group. It has also become clear that anti-IgE (Omalizumab), the first monoclonal antibody registered for treatment of severe asthma, is only active in patients with active eosinophilic airway inflammation. The future will be identification of potentially responsive patients on the basis of raised biomarkers and, as suggested by the title of this review, targeted treatment with specific cytokine blockade that has a direct effect on the biomarkers. In this review we outline an approach to the clinical assessment of patients potentially suitable for biological treatment and describe in detail the likely clinical impact of established and new biological treatments.

       " 'What is the burden of submicroscopic malaria in pregnancy in central India?': 'What is the burden of submicroscopic malaria in pregnancy in central India?\\nBackground: Conventional microscopy underestimates the burden of malarial infection when compared with molecular diagnosis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. Lower density parasitemias serve as a reservoir for infection. We evaluated the prevalence of submicroscopic infections in an area of unstable malarial transmission in India and determined whether these infections negatively impacted maternal or fetal outcomes. Methods: This cross-sectional study (2007-2008) was undertaken in two districts of Chhattisgarh, recruiting women from both antenatal clinics (ANCs) and delivery units (DUs). For ANC/DU subjects, peripheral/placental blood, respectively, was obtained for conventional microscopy and collected onto filter paper for PCR analysis. Results: There were 3425 pregnant women, including 2477 ANC subjects and 948 DU subjects who had both microscopic and PCR samples available. Polymerase chain reaction detected significantly more Plasmodium infections than traditional light microscopy both from peripheral (3.4 vs 1.2%; OR 2.9, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 1.9-4.5) and placental (4.2 vs 1.7%; OR 2.5, 95% CIs 1.4-4.8) blood samples. Submicroscopic infections were not associated with anemia or severe maternal anemia among ANC or DU participants and were not associated with low birth weight (LBW) among DU participants. In contrast, microscopically detected infections were associated with severe anemia and LBW. Conclusions: In this area of unstable malarial transmission from India, submicroscopic infections did not identify a set of pregnant women at increased risk for anemia or LBW. Until PCR techniques become much less expensive and available as a point of care test for the field setting, its use will be limited for malarial detection.',\n",

Inhibition of metalloaminopeptidases PfA-M1 and PfA-M17 is a validated therapeutic strategy for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Here we describe the crystal structures of PfA-M1 and PfA-M17 bound to chemotherapeutic agent Tosedostat. The inhibitor occupies the enzymes' putative product egress channels in addition to the substrate binding pockets; however, adopts different binding poses when bound to PfA-M1 and PfA-M17. These findings will be valuable for the continued development of selective inhibitors of PfA-M1 and PfA-M17. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\",\n",
       " '[Antiproliferative effect of silencing mTOR gene on MCL Jeko-1 cell line and its mechanism].': '[Antiproliferative effect of silencing mTOR gene on MCL Jeko-1 cell line and its mechanism].\\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of silencing mTOR gene by RNA interference on proliferation and apoptosis, and its mechanism on mantle cell lymphoma Jeko-1 cell Line. METHODS: The hairpin-like oligonucleotide sequences targeting mTOR gene was designed and transfected into Jeko-1 cells by lipofectamine TM 2000. The mTOR mRNA and protein were detected by RQ-PCR and Western blot. Cell growth was determined by MTT. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, procaspase-3, procaspase-9, P70S6K,and p-P70S6K were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: mTOR mRNA was markedly suppressed by shRNA targeting mTOR. mTOR shRNA suppressed proliferation and induced cells apoptosis of Jeko-1cells. The cell apoptotic rates were (36.62+/-3.24)%,(2.58+/-1.04)%,(1.24+/-0.30)% respectively, in mTOR shRNA, Neg-shRNA and Blank with statistically significant difference among them (P<0.05). mTOR shRNA down-regulated the expressions of Bcl-2, proCaspase3, proCaspase9 and p-70S6K, up-regulated the expression of Bax. CONCLUSION: Deplete of mTOR gene may be realized through inhibiting the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway to promote the cell apoptosis and inhibit cell growth in Jeko-1 cell line.',\n",

METHODS: Review the data of mutiple myeloma patients and analyze the clinical and laboratory characteristics of CD20 positive patients, compared with CD20 negative patients. RESULTS: (1)Totally 465 cases of newly-diagnosed MM were collected with CD20 expression status detected by multi-color flow cytometry. Sixty two patients (13.3%) were CD20 positive and the others were negative. (2)No statistical differences were found between CD20 positive and negative groups about the sex ratio, age predominance, D-S staging, ISS staging, renal insufficiency rate, platelet count, LDH level and classifications by paraprotein(all P value>0.05). (3)Compared with those of CD20 negative patients, the hemoglobulin value(74.5 g/L vs 83.5 g/L, P=0.021), extramedullary involvement rate (3.5% vs 13.7%, P=0.029), CD56-positive rate(36.7% vs 68.8%,P=0.000), t(4;14)translocation rate(2.4% vs 24.0%, P=0.001) in CD20 positive patients were lower statistically. (4)Compared with those of CD20 negative patients, the percentage of plasma cells (0.400 vs 0.295, P=0.045) by marrow smear differential counting, the percentage of myeloma cells(20.0% vs 6.8%, P=0.000) by multi-color flow cytometry analysis, CD45-positive rate(12.1% vs 4.5%, P=0.018), CD79a-positive rate(9.8% vs 1.5%, P=0.013) and t(11;14) translocation rate(60.5% vs 14.4%, P=0.000)in CD20 positive patients were higher statistically. (5)There was no statistical differences about the overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR), TTP(time to progression), PFS(progression free survival) and overall survival (OS) between CD20 positive and negative groups. CONCLUSION: CD20 positive rate is 13.3% in multiple myeloma pateints according to our data. CD20 poaitive myeloma were prone to residing in bone marrow and affecting erythropoiesis. Atypical immunophenotypes were more common, and the incidence of t(11;14) were increased markedly while that of t(4;14)were rare for CD20 positive multiple myeloma.',\n",
       " 'beta-Elemene inhibits the proliferation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating long noncoding RNA-mediated inhibition of hTERT expression.': 'beta-Elemene inhibits the proliferation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating long noncoding RNA-mediated inhibition of hTERT expression.\\nThe study aimed to clarify the relationship between beta-elemene, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in esophageal carcinoma ECA-109 cells. The proliferation of ECA-109 cells was measured using a CCK-8 kit and flow cytometry. PCR microarray and real-time RT-PCR were designed to determine lncRNA expression in ECA-109 cells before and after treatment with beta-elemene. Western blot was used to detect the hTERT level after the differentially expressed lncRNAs in ECA-109 cells were interfered with small interfering RNA (siRNA). On treatment with beta-elemene, the proliferation of ECA-109 cells was notably inhibited, and about 85% of the lncRNAs showed higher expression levels in ECA-109 cells than in those untreated cells, from which, CDKN2B-AS1 was screened out. A specific siRNA (si-CDKN2B-AS1) that targets the beta-elemene-mediated lncRNA CDKN2B-AS1 was designed, synthesized, and applied to treat ECA-109 cells. Its interference efficiency reached as high as 89.6%. When ECA-109 cells were transfected with the siRNA, the hTERT level was increased by 84.7%. The CCK-8 assay showed that the proliferation of ECA-109 cells treated with beta-elemene was significantly promoted after siRNA transfection (P<0.01). It was also shown by flow cytometry that, compared with the scramble-treated group (negative control), the proliferation index value of ECA-109 cells in the si-CDKN2B-AS1 treatment group was notably increased (25.7 vs. 51.7%) and the TERT protein level was increased by 67.25% after the cells were treated with si-CDKN2B-AS1. The chemotherapeutic drug beta-elemene suppressed the proliferation of esophageal carcinoma ECA-109 cells by regulating the inhibition of hTERT expression by lncRNA CDKN2B-AS1.'}"
