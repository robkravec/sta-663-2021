## Synopsis

STA 663: Computational Statistics and Statistical Computing

This course is designed for graduate research students who need to analyze complex data sets, and/or implement efficient statistical algorithms from the literature. We focus on the following analytical skills:

Functional programming in Python: Python is a dynamic programming language that is increasingly dominant in many scientific domains such as data science, computer vision and machine learning. The course will develop fluency in Python and its standard scientific scientific computing numerical and visualization packages. As most modern parallel and distributed programming libraries such as  TensorFlow emphasize use of pure functions and lazy evaluation, we will also develop the ability to program in a functional style in Python.

Statistical algorithms: Statisticians need to understand the methods they use, so that the methods can be used appropriately and extended if necessary. Using Python, we will study common numerical algorithms used in statistical model construction and fitting, starting with the basic tools for solving numerical problems, and moving on to statistical inference using optimization and simulation strategies in both frequentist and Bayesian settings. Foundational concepts from linear algebra, calculus and probability will be reviewed where needed.

Improving performance: With real-world data being generated at an ever-increasing clip, we also need to be concerned with computational performance, so that we can complete our calculations in a reasonable time or handle data that is too large to fit into memory. To do so, we need to understand how to evaluate the performance of different data structures and algorithms, language-specific idioms for efficient data processing, native code compilation, and exploit resources for parallel computing, including statistical approaches that capitalize on the high-performance libraries originally developed for deep learning.

The capstone project involves the creation of an optimized Python package implementing a statistical algorithm from the research literature.

## Learning objectives

- Develop fluency in Python, especially the functional style, for scientific computing
- Understand how common numerical algorithms used in frequentist, Bayesian and machine learning settings work
- Implement, test, optimize, and package a statistical algorithm

Note: The syllabus is aspirational and is likely to be adjusted over the semester depending on how fast we are able to cover the material.
